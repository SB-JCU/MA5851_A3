      "November 17, 2023\n",
      "Dear Mr. Vohra:\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Cipla Limited, FEI 3008581988, at Plot No. 9 & 10, Pharma Zone Phase II, Sector III, Indore Special Economic Zone, Pithampur, District Dhar, Madhya Pradesh 454775, India, from February 6 to February 17, 2023.\n",
      "This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n",
      "Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "In addition, the inspection revealed that your firm failed to submit a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) Field Alert Report (FAR) to FDA within three working days of receipt of information concerning significant chemical, physical, or other change or deterioration in a distributed drug product, as required by section 505(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(k) and stipulated by the regulation 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1)(ii).\n",
      "We reviewed your March 10, 2023 response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.\n",
      "During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.\n",
      "1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).\n",
      "Your investigations into quality defect complaints of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol were inadequate because they lacked appropriate and timely corrective actions and preventive actions (CAPAs). You also failed to extend your investigations to other potentially affected batches.\n",
      "Your firm received a very high number of complaints (approximately 3,000) from the start of commercial manufacturing in April 2020 to December 2022. In January 2021, you concluded that there was no risk to product quality and patient safety based on a risk assessment. Approximately 91% of these complaints were categorized as “no spray” or “empty/less weight.” Furthermore, many of these complaints remained open for extended periods of time (up to 314 days).\n",
      "You concluded that (b)(4) particles from the metered dose inhaler (MDI) valves became lodged in the actuators, blocking drug delivery. The MDI valve manufacturer, (b)(4), identified four valve lots that were potentially affected by this issue. These four valve lots were used to manufacture over (b)(4) batches of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol. In addition, in at least two cases, your investigation into complaints received in 2021 confirmed inhalers were not able to deliver medication due to the defective valve lots.\n",
      "While your investigation identified a critical issue with the container-closure system in which particles were blocking the path of the drug delivery, you classified the “Final Severity of Complaint” as “Non-Critical,” determined that no FAR was required, and concluded that no market action was warranted. The impacted Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol batches remained on the market through expiry.\n",
      "Inadequate container-closure parts or assembly processes can directly lead to production of poor-quality inhaler medicines with severe functionality or integrity defects, including but not limited to failure to dispense, inadequate dosing, or leaking units. It is essential that your manufacturing processes remain in a continued state of control to ensure that your rescue inhaler products reproducibly deliver the required dose for consumers who rely on your medicines.\n",
      "In your response, you state there are adequate controls in place and the number of complaints received through December 2022, for product quality issues represent 0.011% of total units distributed. You also state your belief that the two complaints with defective valve components verified in your laboratory investigation were “isolated events.” Furthermore, you indicate that because you anticipate no additional defective units will be present in the market, you did not submit a FAR and no market action was being contemplated.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate as the issue with defective valves appears to be unresolved. According to your response, you received numerous additional complaints (about 2,000) between January 2023 and August 2023, with similar issues such as “no spray,” “empty/less weight,” and leaky containers. The batches associated with these complaints used valve lots beyond the four vendor lots previously identified as potentially affected. Many complaints are still under investigation.\n",
      "Your justification for not taking market action is inadequate. The ratio of the number of spontaneous complaints received from customers to the total number of units distributed is not an acceptable indicator of product quality and does not safeguard consumers. You failed to demonstrate that your production design, controls, and input materials are capable of robustly producing units with reliable functionality.\n",
      "The number of complaints you received showed a marked and adverse trend of critical drug delivery failures which fundamentally impacted the ability of patients to use your Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol. Your complaint system was ineffective. For example, you emphasized the number of complaints verified in your laboratory investigation without appropriately evaluating the severity of the complaints. Also, passing results of retain sample testing cannot be used as a reason to disregard the validity of complaints that are of high severity and occur at a low frequency. For guidance on the principles and application of quality risk management, see FDA’s guidance Q9 Quality Risk Management at https://www.fda.gov/media/167721/download.\n",
      "We acknowledge your firm initiated a Class I recall on June 27, 2023, for six batches of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol due to a defective valve lot that had a partially missing bottom seat (gasket). However, your firm failed to perform a comprehensive risk assessment by extending the investigations to other batches potentially impacted by defective container-closure components and to adequately determine the scope of the recall.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "A comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, out-of-specification (OOS) results, and failures. Provide a detailed action plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA effectiveness, quality unit (QU) oversight, and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted.\n",
      "An independent assessment of your CAPA program. Based on this assessment, provide a plan that evaluates and remediates the program, including but not limited to ensuring robust:\n",
      "    o Triggers for fulfilling both corrective and preventive objectives\n",
      "    o Root cause analysis\n",
      "    o CAPA effectiveness\n",
      "    o Analysis of investigations trends on a routine basis\n",
      "    o CAPA program improvements, whenever needed\n",

      "    o All investigations related to “confirmed” and “unconfirmed” container-closure defects, the level of criticality for each defect, all potentially impacted batches (i.e., distributed, undistributed and rejected batches; approved and pending application drug products), and any associated issues identified during both product/process development and via commercial batch experience. o The sufficiency (i.e., scope, trend analysis, root cause, CAPA) of the investigations, whether the complaint sample was obtained, all results of analysis of complaint and reserve samples.\n",
      "An independent, comprehensive review of your company’s complaint handling program that identifies deficiencies and a corresponding CAPA.\n",
      "A management strategy including the interim measures describing the actions you have taken or will take to protect patients and to ensure the quality of your drugs, such as notifying your customers, recalling product, conducting additional testing, supplier changes, adding batches to your stability program to assure stability, drug application actions, and steps to enhance vigilance in response to serious quality complaints.\n",
      "2. Your firm failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures that are designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes (21 CFR 211.113(b)).\n",
      "Media Fill Contamination Incidents\n",
      "You failed to appropriately evaluate a pattern of media fill failures in your facility and afford sufficient attention to potential correlations among these contamination events. Between February 2021 and March 2022, there were multiple aborted and contaminated media fills on (b)(4) filling lines (b)(4) and (b)(4) (solution and suspension lines). For example,\n",
      "In September 2021, you isolated a gram-negative microbe, Ralstonia picketii, from multiple media fill (b)(4) of Batch # (b)(4) manufactured on the (b)(4) suspension line. You identified multiple deviations such as damaged filter housing, choked (b)(4), dislocation of the filter, and ineffective (b)(4) processes.\n",
      "In November 2021, you isolated Pseudomonas stutzeri from one (b)(4) of media fill Batch # (b)(4) manufactured on the (b)(4) suspension line. This media fill (Batch # (b)(4)) was performed as part of the initial qualification of the suspension line and as a corrective action for a previously failed media fill on the same line (Batch #(b)(4)). You identified Pseudomonas stutzeri to be a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen. Your investigation, reviewed during the inspection and further described in your response, indicated this contamination was due to a puncture in the body of the (b)(4) by a (b)(4) during handling or movement of the filled samples, storage, or visual inspection, prior to incubation. However, you lacked adequate evidence that described mishandling of (b)(4). Further, your investigation also does not include comprehensive steps to prevent future mishandling of incubated units, and indicates use of (b)(4) will still be permitted. Your QU approved the investigation and the media fill run for Batch # (b)(4), and you used this media fill as one of three successful runs required to qualify filling line (b)(4) for suspension products.\n",
      "In March 2022, you isolated Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in multiple media fill (b)(4) of Batch # (b)(4). You identified Stenotrophomonas maltophilia to be a drug-resistant gram-negative emerging global opportunistic pathogen with a known propensity for biofilm formation. You determined the root cause to be a leakage caused by a damaged valve gasket and deformed filter.\n",
      "You failed to appropriately investigate root causes and implement effective CAPAs to prevent recurrence of contamination events. For example, you failed to substantively evaluate the personnel and environmental monitoring (EM) data obtained during the production of these media fill batches, and to comprehensively assess additional historical data from the manufacturing area.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate because there is no overall assessment of these atypical invalidations of media fills, explanation of the adverse pattern of gram-negative microbe findings in your aseptic processing operational environment, or major improvements to ensure more reliable aseptic operational design and equipment maintenance.\n",
      "The presence of any highly pathogenic microorganism in your aseptic processing environment presents a heightened risk to patients who are, for example, immunocompromised, have cystic fibrosis, or have chronic obstructive airway disease. Presence of such microbes should receive urgent investigation and effective remediation. Further, it is critical to ensure appropriate equipment design and maintenance, as equipment failures may not be easily observable and contamination events during commercial manufacturing may go undetected for substantial periods of time.\n",
      "It is essential to address potential contamination hazards in your manufacturing environment in a timely manner. Any adverse microbiological trends and potential routes of contamination should be identified promptly, allowing for implementation of appropriate follow-up measures to prevent contamination. It should also be noted that finished product testing alone cannot establish sterility of all units because contamination is typically episodic and not uniformly distributed.\n",
      "Environmental Monitoring\n",
      "You failed to provide adequate justification for the discontinuation of filling (b)(4) surface monitoring on your (b)(4) lines. For example, prior to January 2020, your EM plan required collection of surface samples from (b)(4) filling (b)(4) at the (b)(4) of filling of (b)(4) batch. However, from January 2020 to August 2022, you did not collect surface samples from the (b)(4) filling (b)(4) at the (b)(4) of filling of (b)(4) batch.\n",
      "You revised your EM plan in August 2022 to perform surface monitoring of (b)(4) filling (b)(4), the (b)(4), at the (b)(4) of filling of (b)(4) batch. You lack a justification for sufficiency of your sampling plan, including its failure to rotate sampling among each of the (b)(4).\n",
      "In your response, you state you have adequate controls in place to assure sterility of products manufactured on your (b)(4) lines and there is no impact on the sterility of batches manufactured on these lines.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate in that it lacks a scientifically sound EM plan.\n",
      "Vigilant and responsive EM programs should be designed to provide meaningful information on the state of control of your aseptic processing environment and ancillary classified areas.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "A comprehensive, independent third-party review of your media fill program.\n",
      "An independent review of the source of recurring gram negatives isolated from your aseptic processing equipment train.\n",
      "Your CAPA plan to implement routine, operations management oversight of facilities and equipment. This plan should include, at a minimum:\n",
      "    o Improved production management oversight that ensures prompt detection of equipment, facility, and process performance issues\n",
      "    o Timely upgrades to equipment and facilities\n",
      "    o Adherence to appropriate preventive maintenance schedules\n",
      "    o Effective execution of repairs\n",
      "    o Allocation of appropriate resources, staffing, and competencies\n",
      "    o Appropriately qualified production supervisors and managers\n",
      "    o Improved systems for ongoing management review\n",
      "    o A provision(s) that appropriate actions are taken throughout the company network\n",
      "    o A thorough evaluation and risk assessment that addresses the suitability of your equipment for its intended use. Include an evaluation whether equipment is of appropriate design and your ongoing control and maintenance program is effective.\n",
      "A retrospective evaluation by a qualified consult of the sufficiency of investigations and the failure modes related to the capability of your aseptic processing operation to robustly produce sterile drugs including, but not limited, to:\n",
      "    o All media fill contamination events, invalidated media fills, and sterility positive test results for the past four years, regardless of whether the batch was shipped to the U.S.\n",
      "    o Identification of all potential failure modes associated with these media fill and sterility positives.\n",
      "    o A detailed evaluation and description of each aseptic connection and manipulation made starting with, and downstream of, the (b)(4) filter including but not limited to any manipulations at sampling ports in the product flow pathway prior to filling.\n",
      "    o A comparison of your aseptic manufacturing process to the process simulation protocol to identify areas in which media fills may be improved to simulate actual operations more accurately.\n",
      "    o Detailed media fill criteria used by your firm, and adequacy of provisions to ensure thorough investigation of any contamination.\n",
      "    o All changes implemented to your aseptic operations in response to any aseptic process simulation incidents and sterility failures for the past four years, including an evaluation of their adequacy and sufficiency, and a risk assessment of any distributed product affected by deficient aseptic processing operations that occurred during this period.\n",
      "    o Your plan to ensure appropriate aseptic practices and cleanroom behavior during production. Include steps to ensure routine and effective supervisory oversight for all production batches. Also, describe the frequency of QU oversight (e.g., audit) during aseptic processing and its support operations.\n",
      "A comprehensive risk assessment of all contamination hazards with respect to your aseptic processes, equipment, and facilities, including an independent assessment that includes, but is not limited to:\n",
      "    o All human interactions within the ISO 5 area\n",
      "    o Equipment integrity, placement, and ergonomics\n",
      "    o Air quality in the ISO 5 area and surrounding room\n",
      "    o Facility layout\n",
      "    o Personnel Flows and Material Flows (throughout all rooms used to conduct and support sterile operations)\n",
      "A detailed remediation plan with timelines to address the findings of the contamination hazards risk assessment. Describe specific tangible improvements to be made to aseptic processing operation design and control.\n",
      "A comprehensive assessment and CAPA plan for your EM program to ensure it supports robust environmental control in your aseptic processing facility. Your assessment should include justification of sampling locations, frequency of sampling, alert and action limits, the adequacy of your sampling techniques, and trending program.\n",
      "3. Your firm failed to establish adequate written responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit and to follow such written procedures (21 CFR 211.22(d)).\n",
      "Your QU failed to provide adequate oversight for the retention of original CGMP records. For example, our investigator observed a truck loaded with bags of scrap from Unit (b)(4), as well as bags stored at a central scrapyard intended for shredding. The bags of scrap included, but were not limited to, numerous torn pieces of printer weigh slips pertaining to drug product packaging, and a microbiology laboratory sample label with Quality Assurance wet signatures.\n",
      "Your QU is responsible for the oversight of your drug manufacturing operations, including the review and approval of documents and other document controls, to ensure a complete contemporaneous record of each batch of drug product manufactured. These and all CGMP record are retained for CGMP purposes, such as ongoing control, quality oversight, and periodic reviews. In addition to the critical responsibilities of individual departments to assure integrity of documents, your QU is also responsible for assuring production areas are adequately monitored and employees demonstrate understanding and adherence to your firm’s procedures and assigned tasks.\n",
      "The uncontrolled destruction of CGMP records, and your lack of adequate documentation practices, raise questions about the effectiveness of your operations management and QU in assuring the integrity and accuracy of your CGMP records.\n",
      "In your response, you indicate you have created new procedures for document disposal, revised existing procedures to provide clarity for retaining intact or torn weigh slips with the batch packaging records, and trained your employees on new and revised procedures.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate. It is unclear if you assessed other documents found in the scrap yard. Additionally, your response does not assess how poor documentation practices affected distributed drug product.\n",
      "Your firm’s quality systems are inadequate. See FDA’s guidance document, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.\n",
      "Your quality system also does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. We strongly recommend that you retain a qualified consultant to assist in your remediation. See FDA’s guidance document Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP for guidance on establishing and following CGMP compliant data integrity practices at https://www.fda.gov/media/97005/download.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "An assessment of the extent of data integrity deficiencies at your facility. Identify omissions, alterations, deletions, record destruction, non-contemporaneous record completion, and other deficiencies. Describe all parts of your facility’s operations in which you discovered data integrity lapses.\n",
      "A management strategy for your firm that includes the details of your global corrective action and preventive action plan. The detailed corrective action plan should describe how you intend to ensure the reliability and completeness of all the data you generate including analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted to FDA.\n",
      "A complete assessment of documentation systems used throughout your manufacturing and laboratory operations to determine where documentation practices are insufficient. Include a detailed CAPA plan that comprehensively remediates your firm’s documentation practices to ensure you retain contemporaneous, attributable, legible, complete, original, accurate, contemporaneous records throughout your operation.\n",
      "A current risk assessment of the potential effects of the observed failures on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment should include analyses of the risks to patients caused by the release of drugs affected by a lapse of data integrity and analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations.\n",
      "Repeat Observations at Multiple Sites\n",
      "FDA has cited similar CGMP observations at other facilities in your company’s network. On February 25, 2020, a Warning Letter was issued to Cipla Limited, Goa FEI 3004081307, citing deficiencies related to inadequate equipment cleaning procedures, inadequate investigations of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter integrity test failures, and inadequate smoke studies to evaluate whether unidirectional air flow exists in your aseptic operations. Furthermore, during our August 26, 2022, inspection at your Goa site, the inspection team identified deficiencies for equipment cleaning procedures and (b)(4) surface sampling during EM of the (b)(4) aseptic filling lines from January 2019 to August 2022. These repeated failures at multiple sites demonstrate that your management’s oversight and control over the manufacture of drugs is inadequate.\n",
      "Your executive management remains responsible for fully resolving all deficiencies and ensuring ongoing CGMP compliance. Executive management should immediately and comprehensively assess your company’s global manufacturing operations to ensure that your systems, processes, and products conform to FDA requirements.\n",
      "Field Alert Reporting Violations\n",
      "The NDA/ANDA Field Alert reporting requirements in 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1)(ii), effective since May 23, 1985, require holders of NDAs and ANDAs to submit information concerning any bacteriological contamination, or any significant chemical, physical, or other change or deterioration in the distributed drug product to the appropriate FDA district office within three working days of receipt by the applicant. The intent of the 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1) regulation is to establish an early warning system so that significant problems are brought to the FDA’s attention by applicant holders in order to prevent potential safety hazards from drug products already in distribution and also to prevent potential safety hazards with drug products manufactured in the future. FARs must be submitted for confirmed and unconfirmed problems meeting the definition of the regulation within three working days of becoming aware of the problem.\n",
      "From this inspection, in addition to the aforementioned CGMP violations, your firm is in violation of the Field Alert reporting requirements set forth in 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1)(ii). FARs related to Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol were not provided to FDA within three working days. Specifically, you received thousands of complaints related to the failure of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol to appropriately deliver medication. No FAR was submitted until after the close of this inspection.\n",
      "CGMP Consultant Recommended\n",
      "Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified to evaluate your operations as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.\n",
      "If you are considering an action that is likely to lead to a disruption in the supply of drugs produced at your facility, FDA requests that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, at drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov, so that FDA can work with you on the most effective way to bring your operations into compliance with the law. Contacting the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you to meet any obligations you may have to report discontinuances or interruptions in your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(b). This also allows FDA to consider, as soon as possible, what actions, if any, may be needed to avoid shortages and protect the health of patients who depend on your products.\n",
      "Correct any violations promptly. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to any violations.\n",
      "Failure to address any violations may also result in the FDA refusing admission of articles manufactured at Cipla Limited, at Plot No. 9 & 10, Pharma Zone Phase II, Sector III, Indore Special Economic Zone, Pithampur, District Dhar, Madhya Pradesh 454775, India, into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles under this authority that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission, in that the methods and controls used in their manufacture do not appear to conform to CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days1. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence.

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Re: CMS # 633737\n",
      "Dear Ms. Song:\n",
      "On March 14 through April 8, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of North30 LLC, located at 15552 Lake Hills Blvd # F-5 Bellevue, WA 98007-5928. We also conducted an inspection April 16 through May 7, 2020. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n",
      "During the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. Because of this significant violation, your firm is not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We have not received your response to the Form FDA 483a issued on April 8, 2022.\n",
      "Your significant violation of the FSVP regulation is as follows:\n",
      "You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods you import, including each of the following food products:\n",
      "Passion Fruit Sauce, imported from (b)(4), located in (b)(4)\n",
      "Taro, imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4)\n",
      "Mesona Extract, imported from (b)(4), located in (b)(4)\n",
      "We acknowledge that during the most recent inspection, you told our investigator that your firm is expecting to transition to a model where the foods are imported by your franchise office in (b)(4) and then your firm would receive the foods after importation. As of the date of this letter, we have not received any information regarding your FSVPs or planned corrective actions. According to our records, your firm continued to import food following the end of the inspection on April 8, 2022.\n",
      "The above violation is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods you import into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)).\n",
      "You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n",

      "April 13, 2020\n",
      "Dear Ms. McCormick,\n",
      "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm’s device operations at Tenderneeds Fertility, LLC, located at 10162 Bradford Road, Greenville, IN 47124, from December 9 to 13, 2019. During the inspection, FDA investigators determined that your firm is an initial importer of devices and a manufacturer of several types of Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) and Intracervical Insemination (ICI) kits. Generally, your firm’s IUI and ICI kits include, but are not limited to, one or more devices packaged together and are intended for use during at-home insemination. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n",
      "Device Violations\n",
      "Our inspection revealed that the IUI and ICI kits are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because you do not have approved applications for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or approved applications for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The IUI and ICI kits are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency, 21 CFR 807.81(b). The kind of information you need to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for your devices is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information you submit and decide whether your products may be legally marketed.\n",
      "Your IUI kits are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1), in that the labeling for the devices fail to bear adequate directions for the purposes for which they are intended, and the kits do not meet the requirements for an exemption from section 502(f)(1) of the Act under 21 CFR 801 subpart D. For example, our inspection and review of your firm’s website (https://tenderneedsfertility.com)1 revealed that your IUI kits, including the “Ultimate Fertility At Home Insemination Kit with Sperm Wash Medium,” are intended for home use and include an assisted reproduction catheter (“insemination device with syringe”). Generic devices classified under 21 CFR 884.6110, Assisted Reproduction Catheters are class II, prescription devices that require premarket clearance (510(k)) prior to marketing. To date, we are not aware of the clearance or approval of an assisted reproduction catheter or kit containing such catheter for home use. We remind you that inclusion of a prescription device in your IUI kit renders the entire kit a prescription device. Your IUI kits, were they cleared or approved, would be required to be sold as prescription devices and, therefore, must also comply with the requirements in 21 CFR 801.109.\n",
      "21 CFR 801.109 requires that your IUI kits, as prescription devices, be “sold only to or on the prescription or other order of such practitioner for use in the course of his professional practice” [21 CFR 801.109(a)(2)]; the label of each IUI kit must bear the symbol statement (i.e.,\"Rx only\" or \"[rx] only\") or “Caution: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a _____”, the blank to be filled with the word “physician”, “dentist”, “veterinarian”, or with the descriptive designation of any other practitioner licensed by the law of the state in which the practitioner practices to use or order the use of the device [21 CFR 801.109(b)(1)]; and the labeling on or within each IUI kit package must bear information for use, including, but not limited to, indications, effects, routes, methods, and precautions [21 CFR 801.109(c)]. The inspection and our review of your website revealed that the IUI kits are sold on your firm’s website and elsewhere without a prescription or other order from a licensed practitioner, and the IUI kits’ labels do not include a prescription statement as described above nor does the package include information for use. Improper use of IUI kits by laypeople at home may raise serious public health and safety risks, including infections, injury to the vagina, uterine perforations, and risks if unwashed semen is delivered to the uterine cavity (e.g., severe uterine cramping/pain).\n",
      "The inspection and our subsequent website review also revealed that the IUI kits and the pregnancy and ovulation tests that your firm markets are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. § 352(a)(1), in that the labeling for the devices is false or misleading. For example:\n",
      "Your firm purchased products intended for use in animal insemination and resold the same products as device components in your firm’s IUI kits intended for use in human intrauterine insemination.\n",
      "• Based on evidence collected during the inspection, your firm sold one “2 X Sterile Human Home Artificial Insemination Semen Kit” (emphasis added), an IUI kit, in December 2019. According to statements that you made during the inspection and the affidavit you signed during the inspection, you purchased the component devices included in your 2 X Sterile Human Home Artificial Insemination Semen Kits on (b)(4), where they were advertised as “(b)(4).” Based on statements that you made during the inspection, you did not inform the customer that these component devices included in the kit were only intended for use in animals. Use of the word “human” in the title of the kit may have created the misleading impression that the component devices were intended for use in humans and were appropriately manufactured for such use. In addition, human users of devices intended solely for animals may put the user at risk for infection due to microbial contamination or allergic reaction, irritation, or toxicity to cells due to inappropriate material biocompatibility.\n",
      "• Although the 2 X Sterile Human Home Artificial Insemination Semen Kit referenced above was not sold on your website, we note that at numerous places on your website, you include the statement that certain individual products are “intended for human use, unlike many of our competitors whom [sic] only pass veterinarian use devices for women to use.” Including these statements in product descriptions may misleadingly suggest that you do not engage in the practice of representing that veterinarian devices are human devices. As described above, evidence collected during the inspection demonstrates that you do engage in this practice for certain products.\n",
      "Your firm markets pregnancy and ovulation tests as part of certain of its IUI and ICI kits as well as individually. FDA has not approved your firm’s pregnancy or ovulation tests. Numerous representations on your firm’s website create the misleading impression of official approval of the pregnancy and ovulation tests. For example:\n",
      "• The “Premium At Home Human Pro Series Insemination Kit” includes TenderNeeds “Fertility® LH Ovulation Test Strips (Qty 5)” and “TenderNeeds Fertility®HCG Pregnancy Test Strips (Qty 3)”. The product description states that “All test strips are FDA approved and over 99% accurate.”\n",
      "• The “Tenderneeds Fertility HCG Pregnancy and LH Ovulation Urine Serum Combo Test Compare to First Response” description states that “All test strips are FDA approved and over 99% accurate.”\n",
      "In addition, your pregnancy and ovulation tests are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(a), because you include the FDA logo on the tests’ boxes. The FDA logo is for the official use of the FDA and not for use on private sector materials. Such use may send a misleading message that FDA favors or endorses your products, or create a misleading impression of official approval of your devices. Unauthorized use of the FDA logo may violate federal law and subject those responsible to civil and/or criminal liability.\n",
      "The inspection also revealed that your devices are misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), in that the devices were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 510 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360, and were not included in a list required by section 510(j), 21 U.S.C. § 360(j).\n",
      "The inspection also revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at 21 CFR part 820. To date, we have not received a response from you, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483) that was issued on December 13, 2019. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
      "1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for design control as required by 21 CFR 820.30(a).\n",
      "• Your firm has no design control procedures in place to control the design of devices. From November 10 to December 10, 2019, your firm distributed (b)(4) insemination kits for home use which were not developed under any design control.\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "2. Failure to establish and maintain a design history file (DHF) for each type of device as required by 21 CFR 820.30(j).\n",
      "• Your firm has no DHFs in place, which includes lack of a design and development plan; design inputs and outputs; design reviews; design verification; design validation; and design transfer for the IUI and ICI kits.\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a).\n",
      "• Your firm has no complaint procedure in place to receive, review, and evaluate complaints. During the inspection, the investigators requested copies of complaints received by your firm since January 2016. Your firm was only able to supply 38 emails of complaints since November 13, 2017, of which none were evaluated to determine whether the complaint represented an event which is required to be reported to FDA under 21 CFR part 803 or whether an investigation was necessary under 21 CFR 820.198(b).\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "4. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements as required by 21 CFR 820.50.\n",
      "• Your firm lacks procedures to ensure all purchased or otherwise received devices conform to specified requirements, has not identified requirements for purchased devices, and has not evaluated suppliers against defined requirements. Since 2016, your firm imported and domestically procured finished devices, such as the component devices assembled as part of the IUI and ICI kits, from on-line e-commerce websites without documented evaluation that these suppliers were meeting any specified requirements (e.g., sterility assurance, inclusion of expiration dates), including quality requirements.\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "5. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements as required by 21 CFR 820.90.\n",
      "• Your firm has no procedures in place to control products that do not conform to specified requirements. Since 2016, your firm imported and domestically procured finished devices, such as the component devices assembled as part of the IUI and ICI kits, from on-line e-commerce websites without methods to control product by preventing distribution of devices to end users if the devices were found not to conform to specified requirements.\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "6. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventative action (CAPA) as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a).\n",
      "• Your firm has no corrective and preventive action procedures in place to correct and prevent recurrence of identified existing and potential causes of nonconforming product and other quality problems.\n",
      "You have not provided a written response to this observation; therefore, we are unable to evaluate any planned corrective actions that you may be considering or timetable(s) for implementation.\n",
      "The inspection also revealed your devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR part 803 - Medical Device Reporting (MDR). These violations include, but are not limited to:\n",
      "7. Failure to develop, maintain, and implement written MDR procedures pursuant to the requirements of 21 CFR 803.17. For example, you do not have a documented procedure to evaluate information to determine if an event is a reportable event as required by 21 CFR 803.17.\n",
      "Your firm should take prompt action to correct the device and other violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Also, should FDA determine that your devices do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. More information on processes for persons denied a CFG can be found at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/process-request-review-fdas-decision-not-issue-certain-export-certificates-devices. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, please respond to FDA with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n",
      "Human Cell, Tissue, or Cellular or Tissue-Based Products Violations\n",
      "At the time of FDA’s inspection, your establishment manufactured anonymous donor semen, which is a human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P).\n",
      "During the inspection, FDA investigators also documented deviations from the regulations for HCT/Ps set forth in 21 CFR part 1271, and issued under the authority of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. § 264].\n",
      "The observations listed on the FDA 483 concerning these deviations were presented to and discussed with you at the conclusion of the inspection. The items of concern include, but are not limited to the following:\n",
      "Failure to determine whether a donor is eligible as required by 21 CFR 1271.50 based upon the results of donor screening in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.75 and donor testing in accordance with 1271.80 and 1271.85. For example, from November 29, 2018, to December 6, 2019, you distributed (b)(4) units of anonymous semen to (b)(4) potential recipients. No required donor testing, donor screening, or donor eligibility determination was performed for the anonymous donor or the (b)(4) units of semen tested.\n",
      "During the inspection, on December 10, 2019, you stated to the FDA investigators that you will cease manufacturing and distributing HCT/Ps. During the close out meeting, you stated to the FDA investigators that you no longer provide these services. Please confirm in writing that you do not intend to resume any HCT/P operations. If you do decide to resume any such operations, you must fully comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR part 1271, including but not limited to, registering with FDA as an HCT/P establishment, as set forth in 21 CFR 1271.21.\n",
      "Additionally, FDA recommends notification of the (b)(4) recipients of the (b)(4) units of anonymous semen recovered from the donor for whom no required testing, required screening, or donor eligibility determination were performed that you failed to complete such testing, screening, or determination prior to providing the semen to the recipients.\n",
      "Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\n",
      "We also request your attendance at a Regulatory Meeting to discuss the status of the specific steps you have taken since the inspection to correct the noted violations. We will host the meeting virtually on WebEx, on May 5, 2020 from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM Eastern Time. This meeting will also allow you to ask any questions you may have and to provide FDA additional information regarding implementation of corrective actions. Please contact Sargum C. Morgan, Compliance Officer, at 313-393-8253 or by email at sargum.morgan@fda.hhs.gov for confirmation of the meeting date and time by April 21, 2020. A call-in phone number for the WebEx meeting will be provided at that time.\n",
      "If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Sargum C. Morgan, Compliance Officer, at 313-393-8253 or by email at sargum.morgan@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply electronically to Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov.\n",
      "Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the FDA 483 issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n",

      "Dear Dr. Shade:\n",
      "This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the internet address www.quicksilverscientific.com in June and September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Nanoemulsified Milk Thistle, Cat’s Claw Elite, Nanoemulsified CoQ10 and Liposomal GABA with L Theanine. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n",
      "Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n",
      "Nanoemulsified CoQ10\n",
      "QuickSilverScientific.com/Blog\n",
      "• Eight Ways to a Healthy Heart, (which references the ingredient Coenzyme Q10 contained in the product Nanoemulsified CoQ10)\n",

      "• “Stress and mental strain can . . . impair sleep. Return to a state of balance with . . . GABA + L-theanine . . ..”\n",
      "Your products Nanoemulsified Milk Thistle, Cat’s Claw Elite, Nanoemulsified CoQ10 and Liposomal GABA with L Theanine are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n",
      "A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n",
      "Your Nanoemulsified Milk Thistle, Cat’s Claw Elite, Nanoemulsified CoQ10 and Liposomal GABA with L Theanine products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Nanoemulsified Milk Thistle, Cat’s Claw Elite, Nanoemulsified CoQ10 and Liposomal GABA with L Theanine products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n",

You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n",
      "Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.

      "RE: Adulterated and Misbranded Products, including Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n",
      "Dear Patrick Spearman:\n",
      "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has learned that your firm is marketing the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE Gas Evacuation Cannula (Pneuview XE) in the United States without marketing clearance or approval, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).\n",
      "Under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. We also note that the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE are intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-191 in people. As recent as June 22, 2021, FDA reviewed your website, https://www.lexionmedical.com/ and information posted to social media platforms (https://twitter.com/LexionMedical/status/1245400259888582656, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEhxp1fgewA&feature=emb_logo) and determined that the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for the devices as described and marketed. The AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). The introduction or delivery for introduction of the product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a device while the device is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the device being misbranded.\n",
      "AP 50/30 Insufflator and Insuflow Port\n",
      "The AP 50/30 Insufflator was cleared under K191780 for use during diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopic procedures to distend a cavity by filling it with gas. The Insuflow Port was also cleared under K191780 for having applications in thoracic, abdominal and gynecologic minimally invasive endoscopic surgical procedures to establish a path of entry for endoscopic instruments and to heat, humidify, filter and introduce a CO2 gas stream for insufflation of the surgical cavity. However, your firm’s promotion of these devices provides evidence that they are intended for uses such as reduction of cell desiccation, hypothermia, post-operative pain and subcutaneous emphysema, which would constitute major changes or modifications to their intended uses, for which your firm lacks clearance or approval. Any therapeutic, treatment, or prevention effectiveness claims beyond the cleared indication for use constitute a new intended use and requires a premarket submission prior to marketing.\n",
      "For example, your website, www.Lexion.com, contains the following promotional claims for the AP 50/30 Insufflator and Insuflow Port:\n",
      "• Under the sections of your website titled, “Gas Delivery” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/gas-delivery) and “Testimonials” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/reviews)\n",
      " “Less hypothermia”\n",
      " “Less peritoneal damage”\n",
      " “Less postoperative pain”\n",
      " “Decreased amount of pain medication”\n",
      " “Shortened recovery room stay”\n",
      " “Less tissue dessication”\n",
      "• Under the section of your website titled, “Pneumostability” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/pneumostability)“reduce the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema”\n",
      "There are many factors that may contribute to the health risks listed above. FDA is not aware of evidence demonstrating that the AP 50/30 Insufflator and Insuflow Port are effective in the reduction of these risks. Such promotion of your devices for unsupported and uncleared indications, and statements about demonstrating improved safety outcomes, may lead clinicians to overestimate the performance of the device and minimize the importance of other risk mitigating steps, which may lead to patient harm. If you have data to support these statements, please submit that data to FDA for review. FDA informed your firm in written communications following the submission of 510(k) notifications for a different accessory device that certain claims, such as those listed above, required the submission of clinical data and that literature reviews provided were not adequate to support these indications. The respective submissions were not cleared, were withdrawn, or were cleared without these indications.\n",
      "Pneuview XE\n",
      "The Pneuview XE was cleared under K132203 for having applications in thoracic, abdominal, and gynecologic minimally invasive endoscopic surgical procedures to establish a path of entry for endoscopic instruments and to evacuate smoke and plume generated during minimally invasive surgery from the surgical cavity to aid visualization. However, your firm’s promotion of this device provides evidence that it is intended for the elimination of all plume, gases, particles, contaminants, viruses and unsafe negative pressure which would constitute major changes or modifications to its intended use, for which your firm lacks clearance or approval. Any therapeutic, treatment, or prevention effectiveness claims beyond the cleared indication for use constitute a new intended use and requires a premarket submission prior to marketing. For example, the Smoke Evacuation section of your website (https://www.lexionmedical.com/smoke-evacuation) includes the following promotional claims for the Pneuview XE:\n",
      "• “Eliminate all plume, gases, and particles” [emphasis added]\n",
      "• “…eliminating all harmful contaminants associated with combustion, including viral particles” [emphasis added]\n",
      "• “actively evacuates and removes all smoke plume including hazardous gas” [emphasis added]\n",
      "• “…a patented vacuum break which eliminates the ability of any suction system to pull an unsafe negative pressure on the patient”\n",
      "The cleared indication for use of this device includes only evacuation of smoke and plume. FDA is not aware of evidence, and no data have been provided in your 510(k), demonstrating that the Pneuview XE is effective in the removal of all harmful gases, vapors, particulates, or viruses. We note that leakage of gases, vapors, and particulates through the cannula when devices are inserted and removed occurs, regardless of filtration within the system. Therefore, statements including the word “all” or any statements implying 100% removal of vapors, gases, particulates, or viruses are misleading. Misleading claims may lead clinicians to overestimate the performance of the device and minimize the importance of other risk mitigating steps. Medical practitioners may also overestimate the amount of protection provided them by use of your device in the operating room (OR), which has the potential to lead to patient and practitioner harm. Additionally, FDA is not aware of evidence, and no data has been submitted in your 510(k), demonstrating that the Pneuview XE is effective in eliminating unsafe negative pressure on the patient. Such promotion of your device for unsupported and uncleared indications may lead to patient harm.\n",
      "The Pneuview XE is further misbranded under § 502(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(a), because there are statements on your website and social media sites that, under 21 CFR § 801.6, constitute false or misleading representations with respect to another device. Specifically, the information makes misleading comparisons between your device, a one-way insufflator, and competing devices, two-way insufflators. For example, relevant pictures, illustrations, videos, literature, and written/verbal statements include the following:\n",
      "• A picture of smoke venting out of the patient into the OR in the two-way insufflator and a picture showing that all the smoke is vented outside the OR by one-way insufflator on your website page titled, “What Technology Is Used In Your OR?” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/youror). This information is misleading in that it fails to recognize the smoke reduction characteristics contained in two-way insufflators.\n",
      "• Stating, with respect to two-way insufflators, that, “Smoke particulates and some gases are removed however toxic [gas] is vented into the OR” on your website page titled, “What Technology Is Used In Your OR?” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/youror). This information is misleading in that it minimizes the smoke reduction characteristics contained in two-way insufflators.\n",
      "• Stating that the recirculating system of two-way insufflators “[c]ycles contaminated gases through insufflator potentially increasing the risk of cross contamination and build-up of toxic gas”, under the section on your website titled, “What Technology Is Used In Your OR?” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/youror). This information is misleading in that it fails to recognize that both one-way and two-way systems carry these risks and contain filtration capabilities to mitigate these risks.\n",
      "• Referencing a limited selection of journal articles about competing devices under the section on your website titled, “Resources”2 (https://www.lexionmedical.com/insights) and “Testimonials” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/reviews). This information is misleading in that it may cause medical practitioners to overestimate the type of protection provided to their patients by use of your device in the OR.\n",
      "• Stating in videos and literature on social media platforms, including YouTube, that there is “constant venting of gas into the atmosphere” which increases the risk of cross-contamination and colonization of pathogens in two-way insufflators and referencing a limited selection of journal articles, as described above. This information is misleading in that it mischaracterizes two-way devices by failing to recognize their smoke reduction characteristics.\n",
      "We are not aware of any new data supporting such claims. Such claims are false or misleading because data do not demonstrate that the Pneuview XE is superior to other insufflator devices. These comparisons may mislead consumers about the effectiveness of the Pneuview XE by implying less effectiveness of other devices. Misleading information may lead clinicians to overestimate the performance of the device and minimize the importance of other risk mitigating steps, which may lead to practitioner and patient harm. These claims therefore constitute misleading representations with respect to another device. If you do have data demonstrating that Pneuview XE is more effective than other insufflation devices, please provide that information to the agency.\n",
      "Additionally, the FDA has observed that your website currently offers the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE for sale in the United States as being intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-193 in people. Promoting these devices as an effective prevention method against COVID-19 constitutes a major change or modification to its intended use, for which your firm lacks clearance or approval, and requires premarket submission prior to marketing. For example, in videos under the sections on your website titled, “COVID-19” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/covid-19) and “Testimonials,” (https://www.lexionmedical.com/reviews) several statements are made about how your devices provide safety against COVID-19. Some of those statements include the following:\n",
      "• The video titled, “How Does Lexion Compare with other Insufflation Systems for COVID-19?” provides a testimonial that states in part:\n",
      " “This COVID crisis has brought a lot of focus on how we work in the operating room and particularly the risks to us and our patients that could come from some of the laparoscopic insufflation devices [used]…to perform procedures.” (minute 0:23)\n",
      " In the context of COVID-19, the video goes on to compare two-way systems, and how they remove “a lot of raw gas out of the patient and straight into the room…dumping the gas back into the OR room and the OR atmosphere… [potentially] contaminating the device itself [leading to contamination] into the patient or the next patient.” (minute 2:32) to traditional one-way systems and leakage of gas that “escape[s] through any variety of ways” (minute 2:45)\n",
      " The video clip then describes the advantages of the AP 50/30 Insufflator which include, “The Lexion is a valved system [that has] minimal spillage of gas out of the port and into the [OR] room during the procedure.” (minute 6:03)\n",
      " The video concludes that “[a] lot of the different surgical societies have been making recommendations in the midst of this COVID crisis about ways we can try to protect ourselves and those we work with, and … [based on those recommendations] the Lexion AP 50 seems to checks all those boxes for us.” (minute 6:50) [https://www.lexionmedical.com/covid-19].\n",
      "• In the video titled, “Why this Oncology GYN Robotic Surgeon switched to the Lexion System,” the testimonial states, “…but lately, mainly due to COVID-19… I’m using the system by Lexion which to me is the safest and best system out there… It’s just so much safer with the current climate… I would just hate to have a patient who turns COVID-19 positive.” (minute 0:23)\n",
      "Taken together, the statements exemplified above imply that traditional one-way insufflators and two-way insufflators potentially contaminate the OR or lead to contamination to other patients, whereas, the AP 50/30 Insufflator and accessories are recommended for and may be used to mitigate and/or prevent the spread of COVID-19. FDA is not aware of evidence demonstrating that the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE are effective in the reduction of the spread of COVID-19. If you have data to support these statements, please submit that data to FDA for review.\n",
      "In combination with information displayed on your COVID-19 webpage, as well as other areas of your website, as referenced above, where your firm claims that these devices can remove viral particles, these statements and information indicate that the AP 50/30 Insufflator and its accessories are intended for use to protect OR staff or patients against COVID-19. Such promotion of your device for unsupported and uncleared indications may cause medical practitioners to overestimate the type of protection provided them and their patients by use of your device in the OR, which has the potential to lead to patient and practitioner harm.\n",
      "There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.4 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.5 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval, clearance, or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described herein, you sell a product that is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized product for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n",
      "For more information about FDA’s regulation of devices used to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19; frequently asked questions; and other helpful resources, visit our website at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices.\n",
      "FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA's website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the Act. This list can be found at https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products. Once you have taken actions to address the sale of unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized product(s) for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and any appropriate corrective actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken such corrective actions.\n",
      "For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n",
      "FDA requests that Lexion Medical LLC immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the AP 50/30 Insufflator, Insuflow Port, and Pneuview XE, such as the commercial distribution of the device for the uses discussed above.\n",
      "Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your product(s) as safe and/or effective for indications outside the cleared indications, including for COVID-19-related uses, for which they have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that you do not make claims that adulterate or misbrand the product(s) in violation of the Act. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts.\n",
      "Note, there are two response time frames specified. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDRH@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to address the COVID-19 related violations.

      "NDA 205677 HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) capsules, for oral use MA 137\n",
      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Dr. Polymeropoulos:\n",
      "The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed the Vanda Pharmaceutical’s (Vanda) webpage1 titled, “Products” for FANAPT® (iloperidone) tablets, for oral use (Fanapt), and HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) capsules, for oral use (Hetlioz). This webpage is false or misleading in that it presents information about the benefits of Fanapt and Hetlioz, but fails to include any risk information about either drug. Thus, the webpage misbrands Fanapt and Hetlioz within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes their distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a) & (n); 321(n), 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). This violation is concerning from a public health perspective because it creates a misleading impression about the safety of Fanapt and Hetlioz. Of particular concern is that Fanapt is a drug that bears a Boxed Warning due to serious, life-threatening risks, including increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, as well as numerous other warnings.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks associated with the use of Fanapt and Hetlioz.2\n",
      "According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI):\n",
      " \n",
      "FANAPT® is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.\n",
      " \n",
      "When deciding among the alternative treatments available for this condition, the prescriber should consider the finding that FANAPT is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval . . . . Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointes-type arrhythmia, a potentially fatalpolymorphic ventricular tachycardia which can result in sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether FANAPT will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known.\n",
      "Patients must be titrated to an effective dose of FANAPT. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require a similar titration. Prescribers should be mindful of this delay when selecting an antipsychotic drug for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n",
      "Fanapt is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fanapt or to any components in the formulation. The PI for Fanapt contains a Boxed Warning regarding increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In addition, the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section includes risk information regarding: cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; QT prolongation; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; tardive dyskinesia; metabolic changes; seizures; orthostatic hypotension and syncope; falls; leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis; hyperprolactinemia; body temperature regulation; dysphagia; suicide; priapism; and potential for cognitive and motor impairment. The most common adverse reactions associated with Fanapt are dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, tachycardia, and weight increased.\n",
      "According to the PI, Hetlioz is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24). The WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section includes risk information regarding somnolence. The most common adverse reactions associated with Hetlioz are headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection.\n",
      "False or Misleading Risk Presentation\n",
      "Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among otherthings, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.\n",
      "The webpage includes claims and/or representations about the uses and/or benefits of Fanapt and Hetlioz; however, it fails to communicate any risk information about the products. We acknowledge that the webpage includes the statements, “For U.S. full prescribing information, including box warnings and safety information, please visit www.fanapt.com,” and “Full HETLIOZ® Prescribing Information can be found at: www.hetlioz.com.” However, this does not mitigate the omission of risk information from the webpage. By omitting the risks associated with Fanapt and Hetlioz, the webpage fails to provide material information about the consequences that may result from the use of the drugs and creates a misleading impression about the drugs’ safety. This misleading presentation is especially problematic from a public health perspective due to the serious and potentially life-threatening risks associated with the drugs, such as those contained in Fanapt’s Boxed Warning.\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Action\n",
      "For the reasons discussed above, the webpage misbrands Fanapt and Hetlioz within the meaning of the FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a) & (n); 321(n), 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5).\n",
      "OPDP requests that Vanda immediately cease misbranding Fanapt and Hetlioz and/or cease introducing the misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Please submit a written response to this letter on or before November 5, 2018, stating whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253 submission date) for Fanapt and Hetlioz that contain representations such as those described above, and explaining your plan for discontinuing use of such materials, or, in the alternative, for ceasing distribution of Fanapt and Hetlioz. Because the violation described above is serious, we request, further, that your submission include a comprehensive plan of action to disseminate truthful, nonmisleading, and complete corrective messages about the issues discussed in this letter to the audience(s) that received the violative promotional materials. In order to clearly identify the violative promotional piece(s) and/or activity and focus on the corrective message(s), OPDP recommends that corrective piece(s) include a description of the violative promotional piece(s) and/or activity, include a summary of the violative message(s), provide information to correct each of the violative message(s), and be free of promotional claims and presentations. To the extent possible, corrective messaging should be distributed using the same media, and generally for the same duration of time and with the same frequency that the violative promotional material was disseminated.\n",
      "Please direct your response to the undersigned at the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-B Ammendale Road, Beltsville, Maryland 20705-1266. A courtesy copy can be sent by facsimile to (301) 847-8444. To ensure timely delivery of your submissions, please use the full address above and include a prominent directional notation (e.g. a sticker) to indicate that the submission is intended for OPDP. Please refer to MA 539 and MA 137 in addition to the NDA numbers in all future correspondence relating to this particular matter. All correspondence should include a subject line that clearly identifies the submission as a Response to Warning Letter. OPDP reminds you that only written communications are considered official.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. It is your responsibility to ensure that your promotional materials for Fanapt and Hetlioz comply with each applicable requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n",
      "Failure to correct the violations discussed above may result in FDA regulatory action, including seizure or injunction, without further notice.\n",

      "Dear Mr. Miletti:\n",
      "This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://condemnedlabz.com/ and your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/condemnedl abzofficial/ in June, July and September 2021. Based on our review, FDA identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).

      "Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs\n",
      "FDA reviewed your website at https://condemnedlabz.com/ in June, July and September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch. We also reviewed your social media website https://www.facebook.com/condemnedlabzofficial/, which directs consumers to your website https://condemnedlabz.com/ to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n",
      "Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n",
      "On your website https://condemnedlabz.com/:On the product webpage for DNA Dispatch:\n",
      "• “Increases tolerance to pain”\n",
      "On the product webpage for Humaslin:\n",
      "• “Reduces blood sugar levels”\n",
      "• “Optimizes insulin sensitivity”\n",
      "In the blog “Nutrition” post titled, “Maximizing Insulin Sensitivity For Superior Muscle Growth,” dated September 6, 2021, which discusses your Humaslin:\n",
      "• At the top of the blog post, you display an image of a needle inserted into a glass vial.\n",
      "• “Having insulin resistance is a tell-tale sign that you’re experiencing difficulty metabolising glucose, and is often a warning sign of future health complications including high blood pressure, heart disease, heart failure, obesity, type 2 diabetes and even cancer. . . . The good news, is that just because you may have poor insulin sensitivity right now, you’re not doomed to be that way forever. . . . And, if you need some extra help getting insulin under control, Condemned Labz has created the ultimate glucose disposal agent / insulin mimetic in HumaSlin!”\n",
      "• “Make insulin work for you with Humaslin!”\n",
      "In the blog “Supplements” post titled, “Pre Workout Stimulants 101,” dated August 25, 2021, regarding your Arsyn and ConvictStim:\n",
      "• “[H]igenamine [an ingredient in your ConvictStim] also acts as a bronchodilator…”\n",
      "• “Originally developed as a nasal decongestant for the treatment of bronchitis, 2-aminoisoheptane has emerged as a powerhouse pre workout simulant …” [your blog post discusses 2-aminoisoheptane in the context of your Arsyn and ConvictStim, which are labeled to contain 2-aminoisoheptane HCl]\n",
      "On the product webpage for Thyrogenic, which describes the product as a “powerful thyroid complex”:\n",
      "• “An underactive thyroid can bring about a host of complications including depression… What’s more, an estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disorder, with as many as 60% of those affected are unaware of their condition.”\n",

      "Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n",
      "A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n",
      "Your products Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n",
      "Adulterated Dietary Supplements\n",
      "Your products Arsyn and ConvictStim are labeled as dietary supplements. Even if your products Arsyn and ConvictStim did not have therapeutic claims that make these products unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, they would be adulterated dietary supplements.\n",
      "The Supplement Facts panel on your product ConvictStim declares higenamine as a dietary ingredient in the product. Higenamine is a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)]. Further, as a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, higenamine is a “new dietary ingredient” under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(d)].\n",
      "Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:\n",
      "1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or\n",
      "2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.\n",
      "To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that higenamine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, higenamine is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a) and (v)].\n",
      "Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that higenamine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing higenamine would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In fact, the available evidence underscores higenamine’s potential for serious cardiotoxic effects. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing higenamine are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f)(1)(B].\n",
      "Further, your Arsyn and ConvictStim product labels declare 2-aminoisoheptane hydrochloride (HCl) as an ingredient in each of the products and your Arsyn product label also declares hordenine HCl and higenamine HCl as an ingredient in your Arsyn product. Your Arsyn product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl are unsafe food additives under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)]. Your ConvictStim product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl is an unsafe food additive under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)].\n",
      "If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1 Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(C)(i)].\n",
      "The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. The ingredients 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)] because they are not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types. Neither are 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl GRAS under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Arsyn and ConvictStim products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they contain one or more unsafe food additives. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n",

      "Mr. Kang:\n",
      "This letter concerns your firm’s marketing of veterinary products under the Guardian Pet Products and PetStar Product name for the “treatment” of disease in dogs and cats, including all dosage forms of: Guardian with Nitenpyram and PetStar Nitenpyram. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your websites at: www.theguardianpets.com and www.petstarpets.com, where you promote and sell these products, as well as your product labeling. We have determined that your products are intended for use in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases in animals, which makes them drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)].  Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and your marketing of them violates the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Statements and testimonials on your website and product labeling show these intended uses of your products include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
      "Testimonials from Guardian Pet Products Website: Guardian with Nitenpyram\n",
      "The following testimonials were located through the “Product Reviews and Testimonials” link on same page as “Web Store” link. The testimonials were displayed amongst screen shots of consumer product reviews with terms redacted.\n",
      "• “…We had flea infestation nightmares This resolved it.”\n",
      "• “…all four of my dogs had [text blurred] infestations…after bathing one dog to kill [text blurred], they’d get reinfected from the other dogs.  I needed an internal [text blurred] and Nitenpyram to the rescue, I could now treat all four dogs simultaneously…Within 30 minutes after treatment, the dead [text blurred] fell off each dog!”\n",
      "The claims quoted above are supplemented by the metatags used to bring consumers to your website through Internet searches. Examples of metatags targeted to consumers who are looking for products to prevent or treat parasitic infections include: “flea” and “wormer.”\n",
      "Because your products are intended to prevent, mitigate or treat diseases in animals, they are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321 (g)(1)(B)]. Moreover, these products are new animal drugs, as defined by section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)], because they are not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.  They are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. Therefore, the products are unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. \n",
      "This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive review of your products.  It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your products are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. Failure to promptly correct the violations specified above may result in enforcement action without further notice. Enforcement action may include seizure of violative products and/or injunction against the manufacturers and distributors of violative products. \n",
      "You should notify this office, in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of this letter of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law. Your response should include any documentation necessary to show that correction has been achieved. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which the corrections will be completed. Include copies of any available documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made. \n",

      "Mr. Friedman:\n",
      " \n",
      "From June 26, 2017, to July 20, 2017, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators inspected, Vital Rx, Inc., dba Atlantic Pharmacy and Compounding, located at 1000 E. Atlantic Blvd., Suite 110, Pompano Beach, Florida 33060. At the time of the inspection, this firm was owned by Mr. Serge Francois. This firm and its assets were then purchased by you on August 16, 2017.  During the inspection, the investigators noted serious deficiencies in your firm’s practices for producing drug products, which put patients at risk.   \n",
      " \n",
      "FDA issued a Form FDA 483 to your firm on July 20, 2017.  FDA acknowledges your firm ceased drug production on July 20, 2017, and your firm initiated a voluntary recall of all lots of unexpired compounded injectable drug product on August 17, 2017.  Lastly, FDA acknowledges the September 5, 2017, Florida Department of Health order for the emergency restriction of your firm’s special sterile compounding permit, which acts to “prohibit the pharmacy from compounding sterile preparations and dispensing any compounded sterile preparations, until a Department inspector confirms through re-inspection that Vital Rx is safe to resume the practice of compounding sterile preparations.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Based on this inspection, it appears that you produced drug products that violate the FDCA.\n",
      " \n",
      "Violations of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)\n",
      " \n",
      "Adulterated Drug Products \n",
      " \n",
      "The FDA investigators noted that drug products were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A)].  For example: \n",
      " \n",
      "Your firm did not use a sporicidal agent to disinfect the laminar flow hood, an area where drug products intended to be sterile were produced. \n",
      " \n",
      "Your firm has no assurance that the endotoxin level of your intrathecal drug products is safe since you do not have any endotoxin data and your firm doesn’t perform endotoxin testing for the intrathecal finished drug products.\n",
      " \n",
      "Your firm used non-pharmaceutical grade filters to sterilize drug products.  Specifically, the filter manufacturer precautions \"Do not use this product for direct patient care applications; it was designed for laboratory use only.” \n",
      " \n",
      "Your firm has no assurance that glass vials used for filling injectable drug products are sterile.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Your environmental monitoring program is inadequate.  For example, there was no viable or surface monitoring of your laminar flow hood where drug products intended to be sterile were produced. \n",
      " \n",
      "Your laminar flow hood horizontal air vent, through which first air passes, had a visible stain.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Your firm produced hazardous drugs without providing adequate cleaning of work surfaces and reusable equipment to prevent cross-contamination.\n",
      " \n",
      "The powder containment hood located in the ISO 8 cleanroom used for weighing and mixing bulk drug substances housed an air conditioning filter which was not designed for this piece of equipment.  The filter was observed falling onto the work surface of this hood and it was held in place using packing tape, which is a difficult to clean surface.\n",
      " \n",
      "Your media fills were not performed under the most challenging or stressful conditions.  Therefore, there is a lack of assurance that your firm can aseptically produce drug products within your facility.  \n",
      " \n",
      "It is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being adulterated.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Corrective Actions\n",
      " \n",
      "FDA did not receive a response from your firm to the Form FDA 483 issued at the close of the inspection on July 20, 2017.  As a result, we have not been able to evaluate the adequacy of any corrective actions that you may have taken in response to the Form FDA 483.  We acknowledge your voluntary recall of all lots of unexpired compounded injectable drug product due to concern over lack of sterility assurance.  In addition, we acknowledge that you ceased drug production on July 20, 2017.  Lastly, FDA acknowledges the September 5, 2017, Florida Department of Health order for the emergency restriction of your firm’s special sterile compounding permit.\n",
      " \n",
      "Please be aware that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA concerning insanitary conditions applies regardless of whether drug products you compound meet the conditions of section 503A.\n",
      " \n",
      "FDA strongly recommends that if you decide to resume production of sterile drugs, your management first undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems.  In particular, this review should assess your aseptic processing operations.  A third-party consultant with relevant sterile drug processing expertise should assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation. \n",

      " \n",
      "The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations at your facility.  You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      " \n",
      "If you decide to resume sterile operations, the current owner should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter.  Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.  \n",

      "RE:                  Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n",
      "This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.frs.com, www.healthyenergy.com and www.frs-international.com on April 1, 2020, and June 4, 2020, respectively. We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/FRSEnergyEndurance, where you direct consumers to your websites www.frs.com and www.frs-international.com to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your websites www.frs.com and www.frs-international.com offer quercetin-containing soft chew and liquid concentrate products for sale in the United States under the brand names Q-Force and FRS Healthy Energy and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n",
      "There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n",

This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations.

For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.

      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption.  Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1.  Therefore, e-liquids are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act.  These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco.  See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n",
      "Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect.  A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)).  Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n",
      "New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "Our review of the website https://www.vapor-springs.com revealed that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order including: Vapor Springs Black Honey and Vapor Springs Cigafull.\n",
      "The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement.  Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act.  In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "Your firm is a registered manufacturer with over 11,000 products listed with FDA. It is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.  Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction.  However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.  Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.  You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n",

      "Dear Mr. Silovs:\n",
      "Reference# 557305\n",
      "On March 23, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued your firm a letter (untitled) explaining our significant concern with the HACCP plans for your canned sprat products. The HACCP plans were obtained during an inspection of an importer of your canned sprat products. Your firm provided a response to that letter via email on April 16, 2018. Your response included a description of corrective actions, revised HACCP Plans dated April 16, 2018, for your roasted and smoked canned sprat products, completed monitoring records, as well as additional documents pertaining to product specifications and sampling. We have evaluated the documentation and found that you have continuing serious deviations of the seafood HACCP regulation, as further explained in this letter.\n",
      "In accordance with 21CFR123.6(g), failure of a processor of fish or fishery products to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with 21 CFR 123.6(g) or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)). Accordingly, your roasted sprats in tomato sauce, smoked sprats in oil, and smoked sprats in tomato sauce products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.\n",
      "Your significant deviations are as follows:\n",
      "1.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A \"critical limit\" is defined in 21CFR123.3(c) as a \"maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard .\" Your revised HACCP plans dated April 16, 2018, entitled \"Roasted Sprats in Tomato sauce,\" \"Smoked sprats in tomato sauce\" and \"Smoked sprats in oil\" list critical limits at the \"(b)(4)\" critical control point that are not adequate. Specifically,\n",
      "a.  Regarding control of decomposition, the plans list a critical limit of \"(b)(4)\" that does not adequately address control of decomposition in the incoming lots. FDA recommends that firms include in their HACCP plans critical limits for sensory examination indicating that a representative sample of scombrotoxin (histamine) forming fish show decomposition (persistent and readily perceptible) in less than 2.5% of the fish in the sample, at receiving. For example, no more than (b)(4) fish in a sample of (b)(4) fish may show signs of decomposition in a lot of fish.\n",
      "b.  Regarding control of histamine formation while the fish are held onboard the vessels, the plans list critical limits of \"(b)(4)\" that alone are not adequate. For fish held iced or refrigerated (not frozen) onboard the vessels, FDA recommends monitoring product internal temperatures at the time of off-loading from the fishing vessels as an indicator that the products have been adequately chilled or maintained in a chilled state on board the vessel. The temperature critical limit is dependent on the time between the death of the fish, or estimated time of death, and the time of making the temperature measurements. FDA recommends for fish held iced or refrigerated (not frozen) onboard the vessel\n",
      "• 24 hours or more after death, internal temperature should be 40°F (4.4°C)\n",
      "• 15 hours to less than 24 hours; internal temperature should be 50°F (10°C) or below\n",
      "• 12 hours to less than 15 hours; internal temperature should be 60°C (15.6°C) or below\n",
      "• Less than 12 hours; internal temperature below water and air temperatures\n",
      "c.  Your plans do not include any critical limit to address excessive histamine formation in each lot at receipt. In addition to decomposition and internal temperature controls at receiving, FDA also recommends either obtaining harvest vessel records that document capture and holding conditions onboard the vessel; OR establishing a histamine testing strategy using a critical limit of 50 ppm for histamine as a part of your receiving process.\n",
      "2.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists monitoring procedures and their frequency for each critical control point, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(4). However, your firm's revised HACCP plans dated April 16, 2018, entitled \"Roasted Sprats in Tomato sauce,\" \"Smoked sprats in tomato sauce\" and \"Smoked sprats in oil\" list monitoring procedures that are not adequate to control histamine formation. Specifically, your monitoring procedures at the\n",
      "a. \"(b)(4)\" critical control points list:\n",
      "i. \"(b)(4)\" that is not adequate for internal temperature monitoring at receipt. FDA recommends measuring the internal temperature of a representative number of the largest fish in each lot at the time of offloading, concentrating on any fish showing signs of being mishandled and monitoring the date and time of off-loading. FDA recommends measuring a minimum of 12 fish, unless there are fewer than 12 fish in a lot, in which case all the fish should be measured.\n",
      "ii. \"(b)(4)\" that is not adequate because you do include how the number of fish that will be evaluated. FDA recommends for monitoring the decomposition step, that firms conduct an examination at least 118 fish for decomposition (persistent and readily perceptible), collected representatively throughout each lot (or the entire lot, for lots smaller than 118 fish).\n",
      "b. \"(b)(4)\" critical control point lists that your firm will take \"(b)(4). This is not adequate because it does not provide any temperature measurements between the intermittent temperature checks. For refrigerated storage, FDA recommends monitoring temperatures using a continuous monitoring and recording device with a visual check of the record and the equipment at least once per day.\n",
      "You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking to correct these deviations. More specifically, your response should include documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plans, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., records for the production of five (5) production date codes of the products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the applicable laws and regulations. Please note that your 483 response did not include a copy of your revised HACCP plan for \"Fried Sprats in Tomato Sauce,\" that was referenced in the Untitled Letter. Please include any revisions to this plan in your response to this letter. Submission of the information in English will assist in our review. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n",
      "If you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA's DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA's Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert #16-120. You may view this alert at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html.\n",
      "This letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP regulation and the Good Manufacturing Practice regulation (21 CFR 110). You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\n",

      "Re: CMS # 626282\n",
      "Dear Ms. Salazar:\n",
      "On January 11, 2022, through January 18, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of SDJJ Distributors located at 2434 Southport Way Ste N, National City, CA 91950. We also conducted an inspection on August 22, 2019. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n",
      "During the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations.\n",
      "We have not received your response to the Form FDA 483a issued on January 18, 2022.\n",
      "Your significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n",
      "You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, your firm did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP for any of the food products you import, including:\n",
      "Tamarind-Mango Flavored Soft Candy (b)(4) imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4)\n",
      "(b)(4) Caramelo Mix imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4)\n",
      "(b)(4) Jilote imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4)\n",
      "The above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods you import into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)).\n",
      "You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n",

      "This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.plumdragonherbs.com on May 1,2020. The FDA has observed that your website offers traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1] in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n",
      "There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2] In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3] Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n",

      "Dear E Juice Forty:\n",
      " \n",
      "This is to advise you that the Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://ejuiceforty.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\n",
      "           \n",
      "FDA has determined that your Pink Sticks e-liquid is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)) because its labeling and/or advertising is false or misleading.\n",
      " \n",
      "Misbranding Violation \n",
      " \n",
      "FDA’s investigation of the website https://ejuiceforty.com revealed that it sells or distributes Pink Sticks e-liquid with labeling and/or advertising that causes it to imitate food products, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children (see Exhibit A). Specifically, the labeling and/or advertising of the product looks very similar to Pocky Strawberry biscuit sticks (see Exhibit B), a product that is marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children. For example, the labeling and/or advertising for Pink Sticks e-liquid includes the appearance of a box of biscuit sticks that is substantially similar to the packages in which biscuit sticks are sold, an image of arrayed biscuit sticks, and a color scheme that is substantially similar to the biscuit stick package in Exhibit B. Further, Pink Sticks e-liquid has a strong scent like Pocky Strawberry biscuit sticks that is easily detected without opening the package. This labeling and/or advertising causes the product to imitate food products, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children and is therefore misleading.\n",

      "                                                                                                \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Children are at particular risk for ingesting e-liquid products with labeling and/or advertising that causes the product to imitate a food or beverage, particularly a food or beverage that is typically marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children. Moreover, children are at particular risk because exposure to the nicotine in the e-liquid product, even in relatively small amounts, could result in acute toxicity. Child poisonings due to the ingestion of liquid nicotine have recently increased substantially. Severe harms can occur in small children from ingestion of liquid nicotine, including death from cardiac arrest, as well as seizure, coma, and respiratory arrest.\n",
      " \n",
      "Given that the labeling and/or advertising of Pink Sticks e-liquid describes its nicotine content as 6mg/mL, with a total volume of 60 mL, an accidental ingestion of approximately half a teaspoon would reach the lower end of the fatal dose range for an average two-year-old. Additionally, an accidental ingestion of approximately 2% of a teaspoon would reach the lower end of the non-fatal acute toxicity range for an average two-year-old.\n",
      " \n",
      "The FD&C Act provides, in part, that a tobacco product shall be deemed to be misbranded (1) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular (section 903(a)(1)), or (2) if the tobacco product is distributed or offered for sale in any State and its advertising is false or misleading in any particular (section 903(a)(7)(A)). The labeling and/or advertising for Pink Sticks e-liquid is misleading because it causes the product to imitate food products, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children. Therefore, the product is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) and/or 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n",

      "Your Muscle Test, Banish, Ketogenic Diet Aid, and Keto Friendly Collagen products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n",
      "A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n",

Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Muscle Test and Ketogenic Diet Aid fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)].

If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1 Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(C)(i)].\n",

The ingredients Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)] because they are not vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types.\n",
      "Neither are Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl GRAS under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products.

      "Date: July 23, 2020\n",
      "RE: Adulterated and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019\n",
      "This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.akivamed.com on July 8, 2020. The FDA has observed that your website offers a “COVID-19 Antibody Rapid Test Kit” for sale in the United States directly to consumers for at-home use. Based on our review, this product is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-191 in people, and thus, it is a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h).\n",
      "The “COVID-19 Antibody Rapid Test Kit” is offered for sale and distributed in the United States directly to consumers for at-home use without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from FDA.2 Accordingly, your product is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). Your product is also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a device while the device is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the device being misbranded.\n",
      "There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.3 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.4 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval, clearance, or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product that is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized product for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n",
      "We remind you that, to date, FDA has not approved, cleared, or authorized any COVID-19 serology test for at-home testing. Different and potentially serious public health risks are presented with testing in the home versus a healthcare setting. Such risks include, but are not limited to, whether a lay person has the ability to collect their specimen, run the test, and interpret the test result accurately. Your website, www.akivamed.com, indicates that the “COVID-19 Antibody Rapid Test Kit” may be purchased directly by consumers and is intended to be used for at-home testing for COVID-19, including:\n",
      "On your website, www.akivamed.com:\n",

Instructions are simple and on the package of each test. Don't pay excessive doctor or lab fees or even expose yourself unnecessarily when you can get instant results from home. This test is certified and recommended by the FDA. This kit includes everything you need to test yourself for antibodies. The tests are very simple to use.”\n",

We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your product(s) as safe and/or effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that you do not make claims that adulterate or misbrand the product(s) in violation of the Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDRH@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.

This list can be found at https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized product(s) for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.\n",
      "If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections.

      "Dear Mr. Arega:\n",
      "On January 27, 2021 through February 3, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a remote Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of FSVP records that your firm was asked to submit to FDA. We also conducted an initial inspection on November 9, 2018. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n",
      "The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n",
      "During the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1 subpart L for your Black Tea imported from (b)(4), located in Ethiopia. Your firm did not have an FSVP for this product or for any other food product imported by your firm. Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations.\n",
      "We acknowledge receipt of your response dated February 10, 2021. In your response, you state that “we have not developed an FSVP currently in our company,” but that you plan to implement your FSVP plans within the next four to six months. We also acknowledge that at the closing of the inspection, you stated that you will be working to complete the Food Safety Preventive Controls Alliance (FSPCA) FSVP training to develop your FSVP plan(s), however to date you have not provided an FSVP.\n",
      "Your significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n",
      "You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods you import, including your Black Tea imported from (b)(4), located in Ethiopia.\n",
      "(b)(3)(A)\n",
      "The above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food products you import. We may place the foods you import on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the products.

      "Re: CMS # 627216\n",
      "Dear Mr. Charles J. DiMaggio:\n",
      "On December 7, 2021 to January 24, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Fres Co, LLC located at 153-157 Row A, NYC Terminal Market, Bronx, NY 10474. We also conducted an inspection on April 16 to May 18, 2020. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at: https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n",
      "During the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for any of the foods you import, including fresh plantains from (b)(4), fresh mangoes from (b)(4), and tomatoes from (b)(4). Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We have not received your response to the Form FDA 483a issued on January 24, 2022.\n",
      "Your significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n",
      "You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP, as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 1.502(a). Specifically, your firm did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods you import, including the following:\n",
      "Fresh plantains from (b)(4)\n",
      "Fresh mangoes from (b)(4)\n",
      "Tomatoes from (b)(4)\n",
      "During the inspection you stated you have not developed FSVPs for any of the foods you import. You provided FDA with a variety of documents, including: a (b)(4) and treatment tables for the supplier of the mangoes; a booking confirmation document ((b)(4)), a Phytosanitary Certificate, a Certificate of Origin, a Bill of Lading, and a Packing List for the plantains; and third-party audit certificates for the supplier of the tomatoes. However, the documents that are relevant to an FSVP are incomplete, and you did not provide a record of your review of the relevant documents or explain how they would apply to your FSVP program. Thus, these documents do not constitute an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a).\n",
      "The above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "(b)(3)(A)\n",
      "As a responsible official of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for human or animal consumption in the United States, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the products you distribute are in compliance with the law.\n",
      "(b)(3)(A)\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods you import into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)).\n",
      "You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVPs, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVPs), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n",

      "Dear Kyle Ezzio:\n",
      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://lineagevapors.square.site and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, e-liquid products are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n",
      "Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n",
      "New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "Our review of the website https://lineagevapors.square.site revealed that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order including Melon Strapple, Surreal Cereal, and Son of Peach.\n",
      "The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "FDA has not received an application from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the products listed in this Warning Letter. These products and any other new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.

      "This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.goldcrownnaturalproducts.com in October 2018 and has determined that you take orders there for the products New Ultra Colostrum, Melatonin with Valerian, Anamu & Llanten, and Circulation Max. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.  \n",
      "Examples of some of the claims observed on your website that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:\n",
      "On the webpage for “Colostrum Ultra 3-Pack”:\n",
      "“Colostrum has been shown to help eliminate allergies. Colostrum is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound, which can significantly benefit arthritis sufferers.”\n",
      "“The lactoferrin included in the New Ultra Colostrum has been shown in some tests to help the human body's immune system fight cancer.”\n",
      "“Colostrum supplements bought from Gold Crown Natural Products also has benefits for patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. While there are ways to reduce the damages for Alzheimer’s by seeking its proper treatment, colostrum has in fact shown the benefits to help fight Alzheimer’s disease.”\n",
      "“[T]he number of diseases that colostrum cures has remained appropriately high. From chronic fatigue to dieabtes [sic] to lupus and hemorrhoids, colostrum has been effectively accepted to be a major healer in the history of natural foods.

      "November 22, 2022\n",
      "Dear Dr. Pai:\n",
      "This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a joint inspection of your dietary supplement and drug manufacturing facility, located at 37 & 41 Veronica Avenue, Somerset, NJ 08873-6800 on November 29 through 30, 2021; December 1 through 3, 6 through 9, 13 through 14, 17, 2021; and February 1 and 3, 2022. Based on our inspection and our. review of labeling collected during the inspection, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You may find the Act and the FDA's regulations through links on FDA's home page at http://www.fda.gov.External Link Disclaimer\n",
      "We received e-mail correspondences from you dated March 14, 2022, April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, July 11, 2022, and August 11 , 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, lnspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.\n",
      "Dietary Supplement cGMP Violations\n",
      "During the inspection, our investigators found significant violations of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111), Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements. These violations cause the dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet cGMP requirements for dietary supplements.\n",
      "Your significant violations of the cGMP requirements are as follows:\n",
      "1. You failed to ensure that the tests or examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically:\n",
      "a. Your finished product testing uses \"(b)(4)\" as a method to verify if finished product specifications for strength have been met for your (b)(4) Softgels - lot (b)(4), (b)(4) Mini Softgels - lot (b)(4), (b)(4) Softgels - lot (b)(4), (b)(4) Softgels - lot (b)(4), and (b)(4) Formula Softgels - lot (b)(4). Finished product testing using \"(b)(4)\" is not an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify finished product specifications.\n",
      "i. For your (b)(4) Softgels product: You use \"(b)(4)\" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for ingredients including, but not limited to, (b)(4).\n",
      "ii. For your (b)(4) Mini Softgels product: You use \"(b)(4)\" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for each of the ingredients in the product. In addition, during the inspection, you stated that no testing for the strength of any ingredient has been conducted for this product.\n",
      "iii. For your (b)(4) Softgels product: You use \"(b)(4)\" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients (b)(4) extract and (b)(4) extract. Your specifications for this product, dated May 20, 2021, removed a test for the strength of (b)(4), a maker in the (b)(4) extract. The previous version of your specifications, dated November 6, 2020, included a test for (b)(4) to determine the amount of (b)(4) using your method, \"MSIH-201 ,\" instead of \"(b)(4).\" During the inspection, you indicated the change to \"(b)(4)\" was at the request of the customer, as documented in your change control document dated May 18, 2021. You could not provide a basis for why removing this test and replacing it with \"(b)(4)\" would ensure the product met finished product specifications.\n",
      "iv. For your (b)(4) Softgels product: You use \"(b)(4)\" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients (b)(4).\n",
      "v. For your (b)(4) Formula Softgel product: You use \"(b)(4)\" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients (b)(4) (standardized to (b)(4)), (b)(4) Extract, (b)(4) Paste, (b)(4) Extract, (b)(4) Oil, (b)(4) (from (b)(4)), (b)(4) Extract, (b)(4), (b)(4) Extract (standardized to (b)(4)), and (b)(4) Extract (standardized to (b)(4)).\n",
      "b. You use FTIR for identity testing for some of the ingredients in your dietary supplement products. Your procedure, RMA-279, \"Testing Procedure for Identification by IR in Raw Material\" requires comparison of the sample spectrum to a \"Reference Standard/Reference Sample or Monograph Spectrum.\" During the inspection, you informed our investigators that your firm uses a purchased reference standard if there is one commercially available. For many of the ingredients, you use a reference sample because there is no reference standard available. A reference sample is a previous lot of the material from the vendor or a sample provided from the vendor to be used as reference material. However, your laboratory does not require verification of the previous lot or that the provided material is appropriate for use as a standard. Identity testing using FTIR to compare the sample spectrum to an unverified reference sample is not an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify that specifications are met. For example:\n",
      "i. (b)(4): You used FTIR for identity testing of (b)(4) lot (b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard. In addition, (b)(4) is received as a pre-blend of (b)(4) different ingredients. During the inspection, you stated that FTIR cannot determine if each of the ingredients is present in the product. Identity testing must be able to confirm the identity of each ingredient in the finished product. (b)(4) lot (b)(4) was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement (b)(4) Softgel lot (b)(4).\n",
      "ii. (b)(4) Extract: You used FTIR for identity testing of (b)(4) Extract lot (b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard. (b)(4) lot (b)(4) was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement (b)(4) Softgel lot (b)(4).\n",
      "iii. (b)(4) Extract: You used FTIR for identity testing of (b)(4) Extract lot (b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard. (b)(4) Extract lot (b)(4) was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement (b)(4) lot (b)(4).\n",
      "c. You use the (b)(4) Test Method to test your dietary supplement products for compliance with microbial specifications. This system includes testing for:\n",
      "Total aerobic plate count, procedure MICROSTP-001\n",
      "Yeast and mold, procedure MICROSTP-002\n",
      "Salmonella, procedure MICROSTP-003\n",
      "Staphylococcus aureus, procedure MICROSTP-004\n",
      "Escherichia coli, procedure MICROSTP-005\n",
      "Enterobacteriaceae, procedure MICROSTP-006\n",
      "However, you are not conducting suitability testing to demonstrate whether these methods are appropriate for testing all of your products. According to your (b)(4) Technical Report, dated April 8, 2019, you conducted suitability testing for ten products, but not for all products. The report also determined that two of the ten products, (b)(4), required modified preparation steps for neutralization, or else the test may not provide a valid result.\n",
      "The ingredients and amount of ingredients unique to individual dietary supplement products may interfere with the ability of microbial tests to provide a reliable result. Without suitability testing to demonstrate that a product does not interfere with the test, the method may not be determined to be an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify that specifications are met.\n",
      "Your response dated April 11, 2022 states you will provide new documents and procedures, including Finished Product Dossiers for all the products identified during the inspection and Finished Product Specification and Report Forms. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because your submission did not include documentation that shows that you are implementing such corrections. For example, you provided only draft examples of your Finished Product Dossiers and Finished Product Specification and Report Forms for some of your dietary supplement products.\n",
      "In addition, your response suggested exempting ingredients that do not have verification methods from finished product testing, however, you did not provide the required documentation for such exemptions. Note that, to exempt one or more product specifications from verification requirements under 21 CFR 111.75(d), you must document why any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, and any other information, will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch, and your quality control personnel must review and approve the documentation that you provide.\n",
      "2. Your firm's quality control personnel failed to conduct a material review and make a disposition decision when the established specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(a)(1).\n",
      "Specifically, out of specification results were received for the following components and finished products:(b)(4) lot (b)(4), (b)(4) lot (b)(4), (b)(4) lot (b)(4) bulk softgels, (b)(4) raw material lot (b)(4), (b)(4) raw material lot (b)(4), and (b)(4) Suspension raw material lot (b)(4). For these components and finished products, your quality control unit failed to follow your procedure, \"MICRO009: Laboratory Investigation of \"Out of Specification\" Results for Microbiological Testing,\" which outlines the appropriate steps when a microbial specification is not met during testing. Your procedure states, if laboratory testing results fail to meet the specification, \"(b)(4)\" and, \"The (b)(4) (Attachment Ill).\" You did not follow your procedure to conduct and document a laboratory investigation using Attachment Ill of your procedure; rather, you retested the samples until a passing result was obtained, and then reported the passing result without conducting an investigation for the initial failing results. No material review or disposition decision was performed by your firm in these examples where the dietary supplements or components failed to meet established specifications.\n",
      "Your response dated April 11, 2022 states, \"Investigations and Corrective Actions are completed. All microbiological testing is currently being sent out while improvements to the micro lab facility and procedures can be carried out to address the apparent contamination issues in the micro lab. (Status: Completed on time).\" We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation to support that you have made the proposed corrective actions.\n",
      "Misbranded Dietary Supplements\n",
      "In addition, your product (b)(4), is a misbranded dietary supplement within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:\n",
      "Your \"(b)(4)\" product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, the product's label declares serving size as 2. The directions state to take two (2) softgels daily divided between morning and evening, with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner. Serving size should be one based on one softgel per eating occasion.\n",
      "We also offer the following comments:\n",
      "1. During the inspection, we observed that your quality control operations did not include reviewing and approving the results of required tests as required by 21 CFR 111.110(c). For example, your laboratory Data Reviewer did not review the electronic audit trail for your analytical testing. According to your response letter, dated April 11, 2022; training was provided to include guidelines for audit trail review and are being followed. You also provided an example of what the training consisted of; however, you did not include the names of the personnel who were retained. FDA will assess this observation during the next inspection in order to determine the effectiveness of the training on personnel.\n",
      "2. Your (b)(4) Softgels Supplement Facts label declares \"(b)(4)\" but only lists one ingredient, that being (b)(4) fruit. We note a proprietary blend refers to more than one ingredient. (21 CFR 101.36(c)].Human Drugs CGMP Violations\n",
      "This section summarizes significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n",
      "Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501 (a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "We acknowledge receipt of your response, dated March 11, 2022, and subsequent correspondence.\n",
      "During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.\n",
      "1. Your firm failed to ensure that laboratory records included complete data derived from all tests necessary to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards (21 CFR 211.194(a)).\n",
      "Your quality control (QC) analysts routinely recorded raw data, such as sample weights, into unofficial notebooks during release testing. Our inspection found an analyst maintained two separate notebooks recording different sample weights for the same assay test. Your analyst admitted to altering the sample weights in the approved notebook so that calculations based on those results would meet your release specifications. At least (b)(4) batches of Aspire Daytime Mucus and Sinus soft gel bulk product failed to meet your firm's internal assay specification for the active ingredients. Your quality unit released these batches based on a review of inaccurate laboratory data.\n",
      "In your response, you stated that you conducted an investigation, retested the (b)(4) batches that were released based on falsified data, and concluded that all (b)(4) batches met your firm's acceptance criteria after retesting.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate because your quality unit failed to conduct a comprehensive retrospective investigation to determine the extent of breaches of data integrity found during the inspection. It also lacks a root cause investigation into the original assay results failing to meet your release specification when the actual sample weights documented in the unofficial composition notebook were used for the calculation. You failed to provide scientific justification to invalidate the original unexpected results and only report the favorable results.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide a comprehensive, independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system.\n",
      "2. Your firm failed to establish laboratory controls that include scientifically sound and appropriate specifications, standards, sampling plans, and test procedures designed to assure that components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, labeling, and drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.160(b)).\n",
      "You failed to establish sufficient specifications and analytical testing procedures for critical quality attributes for the drugs that you manufacture. You lacked specifications and failed to test for the 4-aminophenol impurity in acetaminophen-containing drug products.\n",
      "For example, at least three acetaminophen-containing solid oral dosage form drug products lacked the specification and testing procedure for 4-aminophenol content.\n",
      "In your response, you stated that your drug products do not have a specific USP monograph, and therefore there was not a method for testing for impurities. You also committed to developing, validating, and implementing an analytical method to detect and quantify impurities by September 2022. \n",
      "Your response is inadequate. Regardless of whether a drug product has a USP monograph, you are responsible for ensuring you have scientifically sound specifications and test methods used to determine drug quality and purity prior to release. The 4-aminophenol impurity is a known impurity of acetaminophen and should be controlled and established as a condition of release of acetaminophen-containing drug products. FDA is also concerned that you plan to continue manufacturing and releasing the same drug products without testing for the 4-aminophenol impurity prior to implementing an analytical testing method. for this impurity. You have not implemented interim controls to ensure product quality and to mitigate the risk to patients.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide:\n",
      "A list of chemical and microbial test methods and specifications used to analyze each batch of your drug products before a batch disposition decision, and the associated procedures, including but not limited to 4-aminophenol content for all acetaminophen containing drug products.\n",
      "An assessment to ensure complete and appropriate specifications are established for batch release and stability studies for all drug products manufactured by your firm.\n",
      "Your detailed plan for retrospective testing of all drug product batches that were insufficiently tested and remain within expiry. Determine whether each batch conforms to all appropriate specifications, including but not limited to 4-aminophenol impurity content.\n",
      "A risk assessment on marketed finished drug product batches containing acetaminophen that were not tested for the 4-aminophenol impurity.\n",
      "Interim controls established prior to completing the development, validation, and implementation of the test method to detect the 4-aminophenol impurity.\n",
      "3. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).\n",
      "During this ·inspection, FDA investigators observed that your firm performed multiple single \"trial\" injections of test samples on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems without any scientific justification.\n",
      "Your response stated that your firm's standard operating procedures (SOPs) for liquid chromatographic analysis and gas chromatographic analysis allow \"trial\" injections of the standard solution only to verify the resolution of HPLC and gas chromatography (GC) systems, and the \"trial\" injections must be a part of the sample set sequence. Your investigation report PE-22-0005 confirmed that \"trial\" injections were performed using test samples instead of standards.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate. The inspection documented that your HPLC audit trail records showed that these \"trial\" injections were not part of the sample set sequence, which is contrary to the statement in your firm's response to the Form FDA 483 observations. In addition, these standalone sample \"trial\" injections were made before your official reinjections of the content uniformity samples in a sample set sequence, which is contrary to the statement in your retrospective investigation PE-22-0005.\n",
      "The injection of trial samples is not acceptable, in part, because all data from analysis of product samples must be retained and reviewed (21 CFR 211 .22, 211.165, 211.192, and 211.194). Therefore, FDA considers it a violative practice to perform a trial injection. FDA also considers it a violative practice to use an actual sample in test, preparation, or equilibration runs as a means of disguising testing into compliance.\n",
      "Reinjecting to obtain favorable results\n",
      "Your firm lacked adequate documentation of all calculations and rationale for additional laboratory testing when unexpected content uniformity results for acetaminophen in batches (b)(4) were obtained during a process validation study for Aspire Mucus and Pain Relief soft gel drug product. Your analyst noticed differences in the peak shapes, reinjected the samples the next day, and used favorable reinjection results to invalidate the original results. Your response indicated that the laboratory manager was informed of the unexpected test results and authorized the reinjection of the samples. However, neither the inspection nor your firm's response included evidence to support that statement.\n",
      "In your response, you indicated that a retrospective investigation PE-22-0005 was initiated for the unexpected content uniformity results for batch (b)(4) and (b)(4) in Aspire Mucus and Pain Relief soft gel process validation. Your investigation, initiated four months after the event, concluded that the initial results were invalidated because the analyst forgot to add the check standard.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate. Your above conclusion is not supported by the chromatography data available. For example, there were two sample sets run on October 11, 2021 : the first set (without the check standard) was aborted in the middle of the run; and the second set (with the check standard) was completed and generated higher peak area counts for the two content uniformity samples. Your firm's conclusion contradicts the analyst's notebook ((b)(4)) comments which attributed the higher results to the different peak shapes compared to the rest of the samples analyzed in the same sample set.\n",
      "Failure to investigate above limit results for purified water\n",
      "Our review of your (b)(4) system audit trail report noted multiple results for total microbial testing of your purified water system were above limit. No investigation was performed. You also failed to follow your SOP MICRO009 and SOP QA025 which require an out of specification (OOS) investigation to be initiated when obtaining out of limit microbial test and purified water results, respectively. Purified water is used as one of the components in your OTC drug products.\n",
      "In your response, you stated that your in-house testing was for information only and you sent the purified water samples to an outside testing laboratory for microbial release testing during the period of January 21, 2021, to July 9, 2021. You also stated that you suspended all internal microbiological laboratory operations until personnel and resources are in place to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate:\n",
      "Samples to your external laboratory were sent only after you obtained the in-house out of limit results.\n",
      "You lack evidence to support that a protocol was in place for the testing of your samples later claimed to be for information only.\n",
      "You failed to address the in-house test failures from September to November 2021.\n",
      "Your retrospective investigation was performed in March 2022, approximately one year after the first out of limit result was obtained.\n",
      "Your firm remains responsible for investigating all out of limit test results in a timely manner.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide:\n",
      "A retrospective, independent review of all invalidated OOS (including in-process and release/stability testing) results for products currently in the U.S. market and within expiry as of the date of this letter and a report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including the following for each OOS:\n",
      "    o Determine whether the scientific justification and evidence relating to the invalidated OOS result conclusively or inconclusively demonstrates causative laboratory error.\n",
      "    o For investigations that conclusively establish laboratory root cause, provide rationale and ensure that all other laboratory methods vulnerable to the same or similar root cause are identified for remediation.\n",
      "    o For all OOS results found by the retrospective review to have an inconclusive or no root cause identified in the laboratory, include a thorough review of production (e.g., batch manufacturing records, adequacy of the manufacturing steps, suitability of equipment/facilities, variability of raw materials, process capability, deviation history, - complaint history, batch failure history). Provide a summary of potential manufacturing root causes for each investigation, and any manufacturing operation improvements.\n",
      "A comprehensive review and remediation plan for your OOS result investigation systems. The CAPA should include but not be limited to addressing the following:\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Gavin Rydell, Bijan Hamzehpour, Kimberly Lee, and Beecher Vaillancourt:\n",
      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://globalvapery.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, e-liquid products are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n",
      "Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n",
      "New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "Our review of the website https://globalvapery.com revealed that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order including: Fu Man Brews – Charles Dinsmore RESERVE 60mL 6mg and Fu Man Brews – Charles Dinsmore RESERVE 60mL12mg.\n",
      "The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "Your firm is a registered manufacturer with over 2,000 active products listed with FDA. FDA received your Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) assigned STN PM0003515 on September 8, 2020. However, FDA issued a Refusal to File determination on November 30, 2021 which covers 5 products. As discussed above, new tobacco products that do not have the required FDA marketing authorization order in effect, including your e-liquid products covered by PMTA STN PM0003515 that resulted in a Refusal to File determination, are adulterated and misbranded.\n",
      "All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for which no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market.\n",
      "It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.External Link Disclaimer\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Ms. Hamilton:\n",
      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Kaleidoscope Custom Vapor Lounge, LLC d/b/a Kaleidoscope Custom Vapor Lounge manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, e-liquids are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n",
      "The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n",
      "New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States the following e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order: KALEIDOSCOPE Vapor 6mg nicotine and KALEIDOSCOPE Vapor C008 60ML e-liquid product.\n",
      "The tobacco product listed above is a new tobacco product because it was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, it misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting this product was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "Your firm is a registered manufacturer with over 5,300 products listed with FDA. FDA received your Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA), assigned STN No. PM0003302, on September 30, 2020. However, FDA issued a negative action for STN No. PM0003302 in the form of a refusal to accept determination on May 6, 2021, which covers 5,122 products. As discussed above, new tobacco products that do not have the required FDA marketing authorization order in effect, including your ENDS products covered by PMTA STN PM0003302 that resulted in a refuse to accept determination, are adulterated and misbranded. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market.\n",
      "It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.

      "FDA’s investigation of the website https://shop.120ml.coExternal Link Disclaimer revealed that it sells or distributes Candy King Sour Worms e-liquid with labeling and/or advertising that causes it to imitate food products, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children (see Exhibit A).  Specifically, the labeling and/or advertising of the product imitates the labeling and/or advertising for candy that is commonly marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children, such as Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers sour gummy worms candy (see Exhibit B).  For example, the labeling and/or advertising for this e-liquid includes the terms “Candy King” and “Sour Worms,” prominently placed on the front of the product.  In addition, the labeling and/or advertising of Candy King Sour Worms e-liquid includes representations of the product name and color scheme that is substantially similar to the Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers sour gummy worms candy in Exhibit B.  Further, Candy King Sour Worms e-liquid has a strong scent like candy.  This labeling and/or advertising causes the product to imitate candy, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children and is therefore misleading. \n",

      "Children are at particular risk for ingesting e-liquid products with labeling and/or advertising that causes the product to imitate a food or beverage, particularly a food or beverage that is typically marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children.  Moreover, children are at particular risk because exposure to the nicotine in the e-liquid product, even in relatively small amounts, could result in acute toxicity.  Child poisonings due to the ingestion of liquid nicotine have recently increased substantially.  Severe harms can occur in small children from ingestion of liquid nicotine, including death from cardiac arrest, as well as seizure, coma, and respiratory arrest.\n",
      " \n",
      "Given that the labeling and/or advertising on Candy King Sour Worms e-liquid describes its nicotine content as 6mg/mL, with a total volume of100mL, an accidental ingestion of approximately half a teaspoon would reach the lower end of the fatal dose range for an average two-year-old.  Additionally, an accidental ingestion of approximately 2% of a teaspoon would reach the lower end of the non-fatal acute toxicity range for an average two-year-old. \n",
      " \n",
      "The FD&C Act provides, in part, that a tobacco product shall be deemed to be misbranded (1) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular (section 903(a)(1)), or (2) if the tobacco product is distributed or offered for sale in any State and its advertising is false or misleading in any particular (section 903(a)(7)(A)).  The labeling and/or advertising for Candy King Sour Worms e-liquid is misleading because it causes the product to imitate candy, particularly ones that are marketed toward, and/or appealing to, children.  Therefore, the product is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) and/or 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Fahed AL Hassan and Nabeel Mansour:\n",
      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://puffholic.com and determined that electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source, and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n",
      "Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n",
      "New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "Our review of the website https://puffholic.com revealed that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS products without a marketing authorization order, including: Elf Bar TE5000 Grape and Elf Bar TE5000 Blueberry Ice.\n",
      "These ENDS products are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "FDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products lacking premarket authorization in the United States. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n",
      "For a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\n",

Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory or legal action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

      "ADDYI (flibanserin) tablets, for oral use\n",
      "MA 241\n",
      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Ms. Eckert:\n",
      "The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed a direct-to-consumer (DTC) radio advertisement (radio ad) (US—1900289.03) for ADDYI (flibanserin) tablets, for oral use (Addyi) submitted by Sprout Pharmaceuticals (Sprout) under cover of Form FDA 2253. This radio ad makes false or misleading claims about the risks associated with Addyi and omits other material facts. Thus, the radio ad misbrands Addyi within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 321(n); 331(a). See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(3)(ii) and (iii); (e)(5). These violations are concerning from a public health perspective because they create a misleading impression about the safety and effectiveness of Addyi, a drug that bears a Boxed Warning due to the risk of severe hypotension and syncope in certain settings.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Below are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks associated with the use of Addyi.1 According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI) (emphasis original):\n",
      "ADDYI is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is NOT due to:\n",
      "• A co-existing medical or psychiatric condition,\n",
      "• Problems within the relationship, or\n",
      "• The effects of a medication or other drug substance.\n",
      "Acquired HSDD refers to HSDD that develops in a patient who previously had no problems with sexual desire. Generalized HSDD refers to HSDD that occurs regardless of the type of stimulation, situation or partner.\n",
      "Limitations of Use\n",
      "• ADDYI is not indicated for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women or in men.\n",
      "• ADDYI is not indicated to enhance sexual performance.\n",
      "The PI for Addyi contains a Boxed Warning regarding hypotension and syncope in certain settings. Addyi is contraindicated with concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and in patients with hepatic impairment. The PI for Addyi includes warnings and precautions regarding hypotension and syncope due to an interaction with alcohol, hypotension and syncope with CYP3A4 inhibitors, central nervous system depression, hypotension and syncope with Addyi alone, syncope and hypotension in patients with hepatic impairment and mammary tumors in female mice. Most common adverse reactions reported with Addyi were dizziness, somnolence, nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dry mouth.\n",
      "Prior Communication\n",
      "OPDP notes that our advisory comments dated August 11, 2016 to VALEANT Pharmaceuticals International (Valeant) (b)(4). We are concerned that, in the radio ad, Sprout is continuing promotion of Addyi in a manner that does not adequately convey the FDA-approved indication nor the important risk information for the drug.\n",
      "False or Misleading Risk Presentations\n",
      "Promotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the materials.\n",
      "The radio ad includes numerous claims and presentations regarding the benefits of using Addyi for acquired, generalized HSDD in premenopausal women. However, it completely omits all the contraindications associated with the use of Addyi.\n",
      "Furthermore, while the radio ad presents some risk information from the Boxed Warning such as, “. . . low blood pressure and fainting in certain settings . . . [,]” it omits material information pertaining to these risks. Specifically, the radio ad fails to disclose material information from the Boxed Warning that the use of Addyi and alcohol together close in time increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope. For example, according to the Boxed Warning and the Medication Guide, patients should wait at least 2 hours after drinking 1 or 2 standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime.\n",
      "Additionally, the radio ad fails to disclose material information from the Boxed Warning that the use of Addyi with certain prescription medications or in patients with liver problems increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope.\n",
      "The radio ad also omits the warning and precaution regarding central nervous system depression, and it fails to include material information that the use of ADDYI − without other concomitant medications known to cause hypotension or syncope – can cause hypotension and syncope.\n",
      "By omitting risks associated with Addyi, the radio ad fails to provide material information about the consequences that may result from the use of the drug and create a misleading impression about the drug’s safety. This is particularly concerning from a public health perspective due to the serious risks associated with the drug.\n",
      "Omission of Material Facts\n",
      "The radio ad includes the following claims:\n",
      "• “1 in 10 premenopausal women suffer from frustrating low libido, also known as HSDD.”\n",
      "• “Meet Addyi – the first and only FDA-approved non-hormonal pill for acquired, generalized HSDD in premenopausal women. In other words: An FDA-approved pill for women frustrated by their low libido.”\n",
      "• “Ladies, add your desire back with Addyi.”\n",
      "These claims create a misleading impression regarding the scope of the approved use of Addyi by omitting material information about the product’s approved indication and the limitations of its use. Specifically, the “What is ADDYI?” section of the Medication Guide states the following (in pertinent part, bolded emphasis in original, underlined emphasis added):\n",
      "ADDYI is a prescription medicine used to treat hypoactive (low) sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women who have not gone through menopause, who have not had problems with low sexual desire in the past, and who have low sexual desire no matter the type of sexual activity, the situation, or the sexual partner. Women with HSDD have low sexual desire that is troubling to them. Their low sexual desire is not due to:\n",
      "• a medical or mental health problem\n",
      "• problems in the relationship\n",
      "• medicine or other drug use\n",
      ". . .\n",
      "ADDYI is not for use to improve sexual performance.\n",
      "By failing to adequately communicate the indication and limitations of use associated with Addyi, the radio ad creates a misleading impression about the FDA-approved indication. This is particularly concerning given the serious risks of this product and the suggestion that Addyi\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "January 9, 2023\n",
      "RE: 643724\n",
      "Dear Mr. Flores:\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located in Doral, FL, on June 2-3, 7, 10, and 14, 2022. FDA obtained a sample and labeling of your product “SANGTER Natural Male Energy Supplement” (hereinafter “SANGTER Energy Supplement”) during the inspection. We also reviewed your firm’s website at www.sangter.com.\n",
      "Based on the inspection and review of your product labeling, including your firm’s website, FDA determined that “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.\n",
      "FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your product, “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), sildenafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Sildenafil is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).1\n",
      "Information on the labels and/or labeling of “SANGTER Energy Supplement” demonstrates that the sampled product is marketed as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Prior to that date, sildenafil had not been marketed as a food or dietary supplement. Given that sildenafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Viagra was approved, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).\n",
      "Unapproved New Drug\n",
      "“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n",
      "Examples of claims observed on your website homepage, www.sangter.com, that establish the intended use of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n",
      "• “100% Natural Male Performance Booster”\n",
      "• “Damiana (turnera diffusa) It is a plant known for its aphrodisiac qualities that help stimulate the sexual appetite or libido”\n",
      "• “In just 30 minutes or less after consumption you will feel its effect, more energy, more sexual desire and more power.”\n",
      "• “Its main use applies to erectile dysfunction and low sexual desire, but it is also used against general weakness, painfulness, spontaneous sweat.”\n",
      "“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).\n",
      "Misbranded Drug\n",
      "“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 C.F.R. 201.5. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction and under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” which contains undeclared sildenafil, is also a prescription drug as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), in light of its toxicity or potential for harmful effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for its use. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs, including “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA-approved application in effect for this product. For these reasons, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Additionally, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “SANGTER Energy Supplement” does not declare that the product contains a PDE-5 inhibitor. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in “SANGTER Energy Supplement” may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the product’s labeling renders “SANGTER Energy Supplement” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "The undeclared sildenafil in “SANGTER Energy Supplement” also causes the product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because the labeling lacks adequate warning for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks associated with this product, particularly since anyone who takes these products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredient and placed at risk for the associated adverse events.\n",
      "The introduction, delivery for introduction, or causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n",
      "FDA acknowledges that on August 1, 2022, you initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of Lot #48656, Exp. 01/2025 of “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” 3000 mg, packaged in 7-count blister packs within a carton to the consumer level. We also acknowledge that you notified your customers of the recall by press release on August 2, 2022.\n",
      "Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.\n",

      "Dear Kratom Exchange:\n",
      "This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at https://www.kratomexchange.com/ in May 2022 and June 2022, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for kratom products such as “Red Maeng Da Kratom Powder,” “Super Green Kratom Powder,” “White Maeng Da Kratom Powder,” and other varieties listed under Red Vein Kratom, White Vein Kratom, Green Vein Kratom, and Yellow Kratom product categories. We have also reviewed your Twitter social media website at https://twitter.com/Kratom_Exchange, which directs consumers to your website https://www.kratomexchange.com/ to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media website establish that your products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.\n",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving the opioid crisis.1 You market kratom products for the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. However, these products have not been determined by FDA to be safe and effective for these (or any other) uses. Further, the unproven treatments could cause patients to forego or delay FDA-approved treatments for opioid addiction or withdrawal. The marketing and sale of unapproved opioid addiction treatment products is a potentially significant threat to the public health. Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect consumers from products that, without approval by FDA, claim to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat or cure opioid addiction.\n",

Another interesting minor alkaloid of Kratom is 7-hydroxymitragynine that is reported to be more powerful than morphine. However, both Kratom alkaloids activate supraspina mu-and delta-opioid receptors, are the major reasons that the plant reduces withdrawal symptoms as well.”\n",
      "“BEST KRATOM FOR OPIATE WITHDRAWAL . . . While many prefer white strains for the energizing effects, the best Kratom for opiate withdrawal seems to be red strains . . . Thus, it is one of the most desirable for opiate withdrawal than other stimulating types of Kratom.”\n",

      "Your kratom products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.

      "FTC Cease and Desist Demand: In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 41–57, to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease, including addiction to alcohol, nicotine, or drugs, unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For addiction, no such study is currently known to exist for kratom. Thus, any addiction treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims and staff strongly suggests that you review all health-related claims that you or any of your affiliates are making in any medium to ensure that they are properly substantiated and do not violate the FTC Act. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction. In addition, pursuant to Section 8023 of the Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act of 2018, 15 U.S.C. § 45d, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of any substance use disorder, including addiction to alcohol, nicotine, or drugs, are subject to a civil penalty of up to $46,517 per violation and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b).\n",

      "August 7, 2023\n",
      "Dear Mr. Velázquez:\n",
      "Your firm is registered as a human drug manufacturer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted testing of a consumer antiseptic hand rub drug product (also referred to as a consumer hand sanitizer), labeled as Instant Hand Sanitizer LaavoClean without Alcohol and Instant Hand Sanitizer LaavoClean KIDS without Alcohol. These drug products were labeled as being manufactured at your facility, Laavo Clean, S.A. de C.V., FEI 3017301021, at Elias Flores Sur. No. 300, Apodaca Centro, Ciudad Apodaca, Nuevo Leon 66600, Mexico. Following an attempt to import Instant Hand Santizer LaavoClean without Alcohol and Instant Hand Sanitizer LaavoClean KIDS without Alcohol into the United States, they were detained and refused admission at the border.\n",
      "The results of the FDA laboratory testing of batches of these products detained at the border demonstrate that these drug products, labeled as being manufactured at your facility, are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(c), in that their strength differs from, or their purity or quality falls below, that which they purport or are represented to possess.\n",
      "Adulteration Violations\n",
      "Instant Hand Sanitizer LaavoClean KIDS without Alcohol, labeled as being manufactured at your facility, is labeled to contain 0.13% of the active ingredient benzalkonium chloride (BZK). However, FDA laboratory testing of a batch of this product detained at the border found that the drug product contained an average of 0.15% w/v BZK, or 115% of the label claim (United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Limits: NLT 93.0% and NMT 107.0%). Additionally, Instant Hand Sanitizer LaavoClean without Alcohol, labeled as being manufactured at your facility, is labeled to contain 0.13% of the active ingredient BZK. However, FDA laboratory testing of two batches of this product detained at the border found that the drug products contained an average of 0.15% and 0.12% w/v BZK, or 92.7% of the label claim, respectively (USP Limits: NLT 93.0% and NMT 107.0%).\n",
      "These hand sanitizer drug products are adulterated under section 501(c) of the FD&C Act in that the active ingredient of BZK is present at levels that differ than that which is declared on their labeling.\n",
      "While the drug products detailed above were shipped to the United States, information available to FDA demonstrated that all of your hand sanitizers were detained and refused admission at the border and did not enter the United States. Therefore, FDA did not recommend that you remove these products from the market.\n",
      "On May 17, 2023, FDA notified the public of the subpotency and superpotency of your hand sanitizer drug products at the following webpage: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "A detailed investigation into how the hand sanitizer drug products described above, labeled as containing 0.13% BZK, in fact contained an average of 0.15% BZK and 0.12% BZK, respectively.\n",
      "A list of all raw materials used to manufacture your hand sanitizer drug products, including the suppliers’ names, addresses, and contact information.\n",
      "A list of any batches of any hand sanitizer drug products shipped to the United States by your firm, and a full reconciliation of all material you distributed.\n",
      "Copies of the complete batch records for any batches distributed to the United States.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations associated with your drug products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.\n",
      "Note that FDA placed all drugs and drug products manufactured by your firm on Import Alert 66-78 on May 9, 2023, and accordingly drugs and drug products that appear to be adulterated may be detained or refused admission without physical examination.\n",
      "All drugs and drug products manufactured by your firm may remain listed on this import alert until there is evidence establishing that the conditions that gave rise to the appearance of a violation have been resolved, and the Agency has confidence that future entries will be in compliance with the FD&C Act. This may include an inspection prior to the Agency considering the appearance of adulteration to be addressed.\n",
      "If you decide you want to manufacture drugs for the United States in the future, request a Regulatory Meeting to discuss corrective actions.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot do so within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Dear Mr. Tilley:\n",
      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Southbound Vapes manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)). Therefore, these products are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n",
      "The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States Berry Blast e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order.\n",
      "The tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for which no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market.\n",
      "It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

      "The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Singing Hawk LLC d/b/a Sin City Vapor manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n",
      "Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source, and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n",
      "Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n",
      "FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States BrushFire e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order.\n",
      "The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n",
      "Conclusion and Requested Actions\n",
      "FDA has not received an application from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the products listed in this Warning Letter. These products and any other new tobacco product on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n",
      "It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n",
      "The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.

      "RE: 637182\n",
      "Dear Raymundo Osuna,\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 300 N. Macarthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, from June 7, 2022, through June 13, 2022. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your product labels, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.External Link Disclaimer\n",
      "We received your written response, dated July 5, 2022, to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We have reviewed that document and our comments are listed following each of the significant violations.\n",
      "Adulterated Dietary Supplements\n",
      "The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the inspection, we determined that your products, including your (b)(4), and (b)(4) products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.\n",
      "The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to the following:\n",
      "1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity and purity of the finished batch of the dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you told our investigator that you have created finished product specifications for your (b)(4) and (b)(4) products; however, these specifications fail to include established specifications for the identity and purity of each of the products.\n",
      "We acknowledge your response, which states, “Raw materials and finished product shall be tested for identity, purity, or composition as stated in the revised SOP…The Quality Department will be working with the labs to establish specifications for identity, purity, and composition for finished products.” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide finished product specifications for our review.\n",
      "2. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, you provided MMRs for the (b)(4) and (b)(4). You also provided batch production records (BPR) for two lots of (b)(4) and two lots of (b)(4). With the exception of one lot of the (b)(4), none of the BPRs matched the MMRs for the products. As such, the BPRs do not support that you are preparing and following written MMRs for each unique formulation and batch size of dietary supplement that you manufacture. In preparing the MMRs, they must include the required elements of 21 CFR 111.210.\n",
      "We reviewed your response in which you state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP revised and implement the new process in place within the next 90 days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any MMRs for any manufactured dietary supplement for our review.\n",
      "3. You failed to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, your firm’s BPRs for the (b)(4) (lots (b)(4) and (b)(4)) and (b)(4) (lots (b)(4) and (b)(4)) indicate that the supplement products contain multiple dietary ingredients; however, during inspection, you stated that you verify the strength for only one dietary ingredient in each of the dietary supplements. Selecting only one of multiple dietary ingredients in the supplement products does not verify your production and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that meets the required product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement.\n",
      "We reviewed your response in which you state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP revised and implement the new process in place within the next 90 days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any standard operating procedures for review.\n",
      "4. You failed to ensure all tests and examinations that are used to determine whether a specification is met are appropriate and scientifically valid in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically, you stated “the only analysis for the finished product is by input and a (b)(4) test.” The input of the various dietary ingredients during production and subsequent analysis of a single dietary ingredient alone in the finished product is not sufficient to verify specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition in a finished product because inputting specific amounts of various ingredients during manufacturing does not ensure that specifications are met in the finished product, nor does later testing for a single dietary ingredient assess any other components within the finished product.\n",
      "5. Your quality control personnel did not reject a component and dietary supplement for which a specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.77(a), nor did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing that would ensure the quality of the finished dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement would be packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR. You have in-process specifications within your MMR for fill weights of capsules and tablets to ensure that the finished product meets the label declarations. In several instances, your product neither met these specifications nor were they approved for an appropriate treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing. For example:\n",
      "  o The tablet run sheet for (b)(4) (lot (b)(4)) includes out of specification fill weights. The BPR states the fill weight range is (b)(4) mg. The tablet run sheet has weights throughout in the (b)(4) range and notes “tablet won’t hit the weight so running (b)(4).” A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit was not documented.\n",
      "  o The capsule run sheet for (b)(4) (lot (b)(4)) includes out of specification fill weights. The BPR states the fill weight range as (b)(4) mg. The QC capsule run sheet has fill weights listed at (b)(4) mg, (b)(4) mg, (b)(4) mg and (b)(4) mg. There are several notes that adjustments are being made but no corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit addresses the underweight capsules.\n",
      "We have reviewed your written response in which you state that the root cause for the out of specification fill weights for your (b)(4) product was “lack of training” and that you would be “revising your sample run process” along with “[a] new SOP…to explain the sample run process and how to run deviations.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any training records for review, new SOPs, or other documentation on your new sample run or deviation process.\n",
      "6. Your quality control personnel failed to reject the component, dietary supplement, package, or label, when a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70 is not met, nor did they approve a permitted treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). For example, your finished product test for your (b)(4)(lot (b)(4)) includes strength analysis for the dietary ingredient (b)(4). The product specification for the ingredient in the supplement products is (b)(4) mg/tablet. An out of specification result of (b)(4) mg/tablet was reported by your contract lab (b)(4). A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit was not documented.\n",
      "We have reviewed your written response in which you state that “[the] Quality Department will be signing off on all finished product test results.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any test result records or other documentation to show the implementation of the new procedure.\n",
      "7. Your quality control operations for the MMR, the BPR, and manufacturing operations failed to include approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(5). For example, (b)(4) barrels of (b)(4) tablets (lot (b)(4)) were returned to the blending stage for grinding; however, the BPR does not include documentation showing that your quality control operations approved or rejected any reprocessing.\n",
      "8. Your quality control failed to document in the BPR at the time of performance the approval and release, or the rejection of a batch of dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l)(3). For example, BPRs for  (b)(4) (lot (b)(4) and (b)(4)) do not include documentation that your quality control personnel approved and released, or rejected, the batches for distribution.Misbranded Dietary Supplements\n",
      "In addition, even if your (b)(4) product was not an unapproved new and misbranded drug, this product and others would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements.\n",
      "Specifically, we identified the following:\n",
      "1. Your (b)(4) and (b)(4) dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of nutrition information on the labeling for your products does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements in 21 CFR 101.36. For example,\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) Facts label fails to declare the source of the (b)(4). (21 CFR 101.36(d))\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) Facts label incorrectly declares as a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, “(b)(4)”. 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) lists an RDI for (b)(4) of (b)(4) mcg based on the AI (adequate intake) that pertains only to (b)(4). (b)(4) should be listed as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredient.\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) product fails to declare the source of the (b)(4) as indicated in the master manufacturing record; e.g., (b)(4) (as (b)(4)). (21 CFR 101.36(d))\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) fails to express the metric quantitative amounts by weight per serving of other dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A); for example, (b)(4) mg should be (b)(4)g.\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) fails to declare the quantitative amount of (b)(4) with the % Daily Value based upon the presence of (b)(4) in the product formula, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)\n",
      "2. Your (b)(4) product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)], in that the finished product labels fail to declare the major food allergen, shrimp and crab, as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act. Specifically, as you have chosen to use a “Contains” statement, you must declare the specific type of Crustacean shellfish.\n",
      "3. Your (b)(4) product and (b)(4) products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically,\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) Facts label declares the (b)(4) but fails to state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” as listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce, as incorporated by 21 CFR 101.4(h).\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) product’s ingredient list declares “flavorless coating (Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1)” which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient. Furthermore, your batch production records for the product indicate “(b)(4)” as an ingredient but this ingredient does not appear in the ingredient list of your product label.\n",
      "  o Your (b)(4) Facts label declares the (b)(4) but fails to state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” as listed in Herbs of Commerce. [See 21 CFR 101.4(h)] Furthermore, the source ingredient (b)(4) fails to be listed first within the parentheses, and then followed by the (b)(4) name within parentheses; for example, (b)(4)\n",
      "4. Your (b)(4) product label is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761 of the Act) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.\n",
      "This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n",
      "Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n",
      "Your response should be sent to Dana Lewis, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at the following email: dana.lewis@fda.hhs.gov (preferred), or you may mail a hard copy, addressed to Dana Lewis, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at 1201 Main Street, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202.

      "Dear Mr. Aton:\n",
      "This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at Internet addresses www.natsprout.com and https://stmarcusorganics.com in September 2020.

      "November 8, 2023\n",
      "Dear Mr. Pollack:\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, National Chemical Laboratories, FEI 1000071237, at 401 N. 10th Street, Philadelphia, from May 22 to 26, 2023.\n",
      "This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n",
      "Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "We reviewed your June 19, 2023, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.\n",
      "During our inspection, our investigator observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.\n",
      "1. Your firm failed to validate and establish the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(2)).\n",
      "Your firm manufactures over-the-counter (OTC) topical drug products, such as antibacterial hand sanitizers containing benzalkonium chloride (BZK). During the inspection, you were unable to provide documentation of your component testing of BZK, including identity. In lieu of testing, you provided your supplier’s certificate of analysis (COA) without establishing the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses at appropriate intervals.\n",
      "Without adequate testing, you do not have scientific evidence that the components conform to appropriate specifications prior to use in the manufacture of your drug products.\n",
      "In your response you commit to creating a supplier qualification program. You also state that (b)(4) lots of your BZK material will be analyzed to confirm that the specification requirements are aligned with the supplier’s COA. Your response is inadequate. You fail to provide sufficient details describing your new supplier qualification program, including periodic re-validation. Also, you do not address retrospective identity testing to assess the quality of your components used in your OTC drug products that have been manufactured, distributed, and within expiry.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide:\n",
      "A description of how you will test each component lot for conformity with all appropriate specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity. If you intend to accept any results from your supplier’s COA instead of testing each component lot for strength, quality, and purity, specify how you will robustly establish the reliability of your supplier’s results through initial validation as well as periodic re-validation. In addition, include a commitment to always conduct at least one specific identity test for each incoming component lot.\n",
      "Your standard operating procedure that describes your COA validation program.\n",
      "A summary of your program for qualifying and overseeing contract facilities that test the components you use to manufacture your drug products.\n",
      "2. Your firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).\n",
      "Your quality unit (QU) did not provide adequate oversight for the manufacture of your drug products. For example, your QU failed to ensure the following:\n",
      "Appropriate production and process controls designed to assure drug products manufactured have the identity, strength, quality, and purity purported or represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)).\n",
      "Establishment of an adequate ongoing stability program (21 CFR 211.166(a)).\n",
      "Establishment of adequate procedures describing out-of-specifications, deviations, manufacturing equipment cleaning, process validation, and pest control (21 CFR 211.22(d)).\n",
      "Appropriate validation and approved written procedures for cleaning and maintenance of non-dedicated manufacturing equipment (21 CFR 211.67(b)).\n",
      "In your response, you state that you are in the process of implementing procedures to ensure quality control over your processes. You also state that you would perform training for employees. Your response is inadequate. You do not adequately detail how your quality function plans to improve its oversight of manufacturing quality. You also fail to assess the impact that your insufficient QU oversight had on product quality. Further, your cleaning validation does not include the testing of product residues or justification for the selection of swabbing locations.\n",
      "Your inspectional history indicates that your QU is not able to fully exercise its authority and/or responsibilities. Your firm must provide the QU with the appropriate authority and sufficient resources to carry out its responsibilities and consistently ensure drug quality. See FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide:\n",
      "A comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to:\n",
      "    o A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriate\n",
      "    o Provisions for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practices\n",
      "    o A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decision\n",
      "    o Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products\n",
      "A comprehensive, independent assessment and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:\n",
      "    o Stability-indicating methods\n",
      "    o Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permitted\n",
      "    o An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if the shelf-life claim remains valid\n",
      "    o Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint)\n",
      "    o All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program\n",
      "A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification for each of your marketed drug products.\n",
      "Appropriate improvements to your cleaning validation program, with special emphasis on incorporating conditions identified as worst case in your drug manufacturing operation. This should include, but not be limited to, identification and evaluation of all worst-case:\n",
      "    o Drugs with higher toxicities\n",
      "    o Drugs with higher drug potencies\n",
      "    o Drugs of lower solubility in their cleaning solvents\n",
      "    o Drugs with characteristics that make them difficult to clean\n",
      "    o Swabbing locations for areas that are most difficult to clean\n",
      "    o Maximum hold times before cleaning\n",
      "Repeat Observations at Facility\n",
      "In a previous inspection ending on November 4, 2021, FDA cited similar CGMP observations. You proposed specific remediation for these observations in your response. Our current inspection identified multiple failures to implement your specific corrective actions. These repeated failures demonstrate that executive management oversight and control over the manufacture of drugs is inadequate. Explain how you intend to assure your commitments are fulfilled and corrective actions are effective and sustainable.\n",
      "Drug Production Ceased\n",
      "We acknowledge your commitment to cease production of all drugs at this facility. In response to this letter, clarify whether you intend to resume manufacturing any drugs at this facility in the future. If you plan to resume any manufacturing operations regulated under the FD&C Act, notify this office before resuming your drug manufacturing operations.\n",
      "You are responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure your firm is capable of ongoing CGMP compliance. Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, you should engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements before resuming drug manufacturing operations. The qualified consultant should also perform a comprehensive six-system audit1 of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of all CAPAs before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status per FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.\n",
      "Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address this matter may result in regulatory or legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts.\n",
      "Failure to address violations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to address any violations.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.\n",
      "Please send your electronic reply to Yvette Johnson, Compliance Officer at Yvette.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov, ORAPHARM1_RESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov and CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI# 1000071237.\n",

      "December 21, 2020\n",
      "RE: 609572\n",
      " \n",
      "Dear Ms. Carter:\n",
      "This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.glwellness.net in August and December 2020 and has determined that you take orders there[1] for the “C BETTER DAILY Adult Regular Formula,” “C BETTER DAILY Adult Maximum Formula,” and “C BETTER DAILY Soothing Formula,” (hereinafter collectively referred to as “your C BETTER DAILY products for humans”) all of which you promote as eye drop products containing cannabidiol (CBD) for human use. The claims on your website establish that your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). FDA has also determined that you take orders for the product “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” on your website at www.glwellness.net. This product, which you promote as an eye drop product containing CBD, is an unapproved new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).\n",
      "These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans and/or animals if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result.\n",
      "As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.\n",
      "Unapproved New Drugs\n",
      "Based on our review of your websites, your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.  \n",
      "Examples of claims observed on your website www.glwellness.net and/or label of your products that establish their intended uses as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following: \n",
      "On your product label for “C BETTER DAILY Adult Maximum Formula”:\n",
      "\"MULTI SYMPTOM EYE CARE”\n",
      "On your product webpage for “C BETTER DAILY” at your website www.glwellness.net, you state:\n",
      "Under a rotating banner titled “C BETTER DAILY”:\n",
      "“C Better Daily is the hemp industries first and only multi-symptom eye care solution.”\n",
      "“A harmonic blend of herbal extracts chosen for their ability to reduce swelling, itching and inflammation.”\n",
      "“Antioxidant”\n",
      "“Anti-Inflammatory”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under “Intended for Daily Use”:\n",
      "“Organic chamomile hydrosol is the base of all our formulas, chosen for its long-standing history of traditional use as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and mild astringent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under “Research”:\n",
      "“G & L Wellness had introduced the world’s first and only hemp derived multi symptom eye care solution for both people and pets and they quickly started to make their way across the country and the world!”\n",
      "“Applications of CBD as an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, neuroprotective and vasodilator compound are well researched and documented.”\n",
      "“Both minor and major eye related issues are beginning to be clinically researched as to what role the ECS [endocannabinoid system] and the receptors, enzymes and endocannabinoids within play to the overall health and longevity of our eyes.”\n",
      "“N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is present in three of our formulas, Maximum, Regular and Pet in various concentrations. It is a powerful antioxidant. Among ocular research, you will discover that this amino acid is reviewed throughout clinical studies for its effect on cataracts, macular degeneration, dry eye, facilitation of wound healing in damaged corneal epithelial cells and other degenerative eye diseases . . . It is often used as a dietary supplement or as an ingredient incorporated into medications, for example, as an inhalant used by pulmonary specialists in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a) unless they are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products. \n",
      "Misbranded Drugs\n",
      "Your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). \n",
      "Unapproved New Animal Drugs\n",
      "During our review of your firm’s website www.glwellness.net, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drug “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula.” Based on our review of your website, your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and marketing it violates the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Examples of claims observed on your website www.glwellness.net that establish the intended uses of this product include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n",
      "On your product webpage for “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” at your website www.glwellness.net, you state:\n",
      "Under a rotating banner titled “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula”:\n",

      "Under “Consumer Commonly Asked Questions”:\n",
      "“Ingredients in C Better Daily may reduce pain, inflammation and redness…”\n",
      "\n",
      "Your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” product is a “new animal drug,” as defined by section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because it is not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. Your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula”  product is not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of this adulterated drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n",

You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      "You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly address violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction. \n",
      "Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.\n",

Micolucci, President/CEOBoothwyn Pharmacy, LLC221 Gale LaneKennett Square, PA 19348 Dear Mr. Micolucci: From June 5, 2017, to June 16, 2017, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator inspected your facility, Boothwyn Pharmacy, LLC, 221 Gale Lane, Kennett Square, PA 19348. During the inspection, the investigator noted that drug products you produced failed to meet the conditions of section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) [21 U.S.C. § 353a] for exemption from certain provisions of the FDCA. In addition, the investigator noted serious deficiencies in your practices for producing sterile drug products, which put patients at risk.   FDA issued a Form FDA 483 to your firm on June 16, 2017. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s response, dated July 7, 2017. Based on this inspection, it appears that you produced drug products that violate the FDCA. A.    Compounded Drug Products Under the FDCA  Section 503A of the FDCA describes the conditions under which human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or a licensed physician, qualify for exemptions from three sections of the FDCA: compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) (section 501(a)(2)(B)); labeling with adequate directions for use (section 502(f)(1)); and FDA approval prior to marketing (section 505) [21 U.S.C. §§ 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1) and 355(a)].[1] Receipt of valid prescriptions for individually-identified patients is one of the conditions for the exemptions under section 503A.  B.    Failure to Meet the Conditions of Section 503A During the inspection, the FDA investigator noted that drug products produced by your firm failed to meet the conditions of section 503A. For example, the investigator noted your firm did not receive valid prescriptions for individually-identified patients for a portion of the drug products you produced. Specific violations are described below.         C.    Violations of the FDCA Adulterated Drug Products  The FDA investigator noted that drug products intended or expected to be sterile were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA. For example, the investigator observed: 1.  The pharmacist reached over open vials obstructing airflow in the ISO 5 biological safety cabinet (BSC) on multiple occasions during aseptic processing. 2.  The pharmacist exposed depyrogenated vials, sterilized rubber stoppers, and syringes to lower than ISO 5 quality air prior to transferring into the ISO 5 area within the BSC during aseptic processing.  3.  Your firm used cleaning pads or wipes in the ISO 5 aseptic processing areas that are not sterile. 4.  Your firm failed to perform adequate smoke studies under dynamic conditions to demonstrate unidirectional airflow within the ISO 5 area. Therefore, your products intended to be sterile are produced an environment that may not provide adequate protection against the risk of contamination. 5.  Your media fills were not performed under the most challenging or stressful processing conditions. Therefore, there is a lack of assurance that your firm can aseptically produce drug products within your facility. Furthermore, the manufacture of the ineligible drug products is subject to FDA’s CGMP regulations, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211. The FDA investigators observed significant CGMP violations at your facility, causing the ineligible drug products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA. The violations included, for example: 1.  Your firm failed to establish appropriate written procedures that are designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes (21 CFR 211.113(b)). 2.  Your firm failed to establish an adequate system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and equipment to produce aseptic conditions (21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)(v)). 3.  Your firm failed to establish an adequate system for monitoring environmental conditions in aseptic processing areas (21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)(iv)). 4.  Your firm does not have, for each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile and/or pyrogen-free, appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for the drug product (21 CFR 211.167(a)). 5.  Your firm failed to follow a written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of such stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)). 6.  Your firm failed to routinely calibrate, inspect, or check according to a written program designed to assure proper performance of automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment, including computers, used in the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug product (21 CFR 211.68(a)). Under section 301(a) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)], the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being adulterated. Unapproved New Drug Products  You do not have any FDA-approved applications on file for the ineligible drug products that you compounded.[2] Under sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)], a new drug may not be introduced into or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless an application approved by FDA under section 505 of the FDCA is in effect for the drug. Marketing of these products, or other applicable products, without an approved application violates these provisions of the FDCA. Misbranded Drug Products  The ineligible drug products you compounded are intended for conditions not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layman can use these products safely for their intended uses. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses.[3] Accordingly, these ineligible drug products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FDCA. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products therefore violates section 301(a) of the FDCA.  It is also a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being misbranded. D.     Corrective Actions We have reviewed your firm’s responses to the Form FDA 483.    Regarding some of the insanitary condition observations in the Form FDA 483, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy of the following corrective actions described in your response because you did not include sufficient information or supporting documentation: 1.  In your response, you indicated that you will be “retraining personnel in the proper technique to avoid obstructing air flow” within the ISO 5 hood during aseptic processing. However, you did not provide any documentation to support this corrective action. 2.  In your response, you indicated that you have revised your SOPs “to state that the technician or pharmacist will open foil coverings in the ISO class 5 area and to ensure depyrogenated glass vial containers are wiped with a sterile IPA 70% wipe prior to entry into an ISO class 5 area” and that personnel will be retrained in these techniques. However, you did not provide any documentation to support this corrective action. 3.  In your response, you indicated that you have “replaced all non-sterile wipes and mini mop covers with sterile wipes and sterile cleaning pads (including but not limited to mop heads).” Your firm provided a copy of the packaging for the sterile wipes purchased; however, you did not provide any documentation regarding mop covers to support this corrective action. Regarding other observations related to insanitary conditions, the following corrective actions appear deficient: 1.  Your firm did not perform or commit to performing a new smoke study that would include all areas within the ISO 5 biological safety cabinet. 2.  Your firm indicated that you would use the “largest” batch size to simulate the media fill. However, the media fill documents indicated that you will be challenging your process using only 6 vials and the simulation does not reflect your actual process. In addition, our review of the documents collected during the inspection revealed that for your product Myers Cocktail Injection, the COA for the ingredient Calcium Gluconate, USP (Anhydrous, batch/lot number 128749) states “Not for injectable use.” Using an ingredient that is not suitable for its intended use could impact the quality and safety of the finished product. Please be aware that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA concerning insanitary conditions applies regardless of whether drug products you compound meet the conditions of section 503A, including, the condition on receipt of a prescription for an identified individual patient prior to compounding.  Also, as explained above, receipt of valid prescriptions for individually-identified patients is a condition of section 503A, which your firm failed to meet for a portion of the drug products you produced.  Should you continue to compound and distribute drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A, the compounding and distribution of such drugs would be subject to the new drug approval requirement, the requirement to label drug products with adequate directions for use, and the drug CGMP regulations. Before doing so, you must comply with the requirements of section 505 and 502(f)(1) and fully implement corrections that meet the minimum requirements of the CGMP regulations.[4]  In addition to the issues discussed above, you should note that CGMP requires the implementation of quality oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs, including the safety of raw materials, materials used in drug manufacturing, and finished drug products. See section 501 of the FDCA.  If you choose to contract with a laboratory to perform some functions required by CGMP, it is essential that you select a qualified contractor and that you maintain sufficient oversight of the contractor’s operations to ensure that it is fully CGMP compliant.  Regardless of whether you rely on a contract facility, you are responsible for assuring that drugs you produce are neither adulterated nor misbranded.  [See 21 CFR 210.1(b), 21 CFR 200.10(b)]. FDA strongly recommends that your management first undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems.  In particular, this review should assess your aseptic processing operations.  A third party consultant with relevant sterile drug manufacturing expertise should assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation. E.    Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.  Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Please include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you do not believe that the products discussed above are in violation of the FDCA, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.  Your e-mailed or written notification should refer to the Warning Letter Number above (CMS# 560524) Please address your reply to:                                                 Yvette Johnson                                                Compliance Officer                                                Food and Drug Administration                                                U.S. Customhouse                                                 2nd and Chestnut Sts.                                                Philadelphia, PA 19106                                                If you have questions regarding the contents of this letter, please contact Yvette Johnson at 215-717-3077, or by e-mail at Yvette.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov.  Sincerely,/S/                                                                                                                                             For: Diana Amador ToroDivision Director/OPQ Division1New Jersey District Office [1] We remind you that there are conditions other than those discussed in this letter that must be satisfied to qualify for the exemptions in section 503A of the FDCA.[2] The specific products made by your firm are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases and/or because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Further, they are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) [21 U.S.C. 321(p)] of the FDCA because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their labeled uses. [3] Your ineligible drug products are not exempted from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FDCA by regulations issued by the FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 201.115).[4] In this letter we do not address whether your proposed corrective actions would resolve the CGMP violations noted above.\n"

      "FROM: The United States Food and Drug Administration\n",
      "RE: Notice of Unlawful Sale of Unapproved and Misbranded Drugs to United States Consumers Over the Internet\n",
      "DATE: December 27, 2022\n",
      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "This is to advise you that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed your website at the Internet address www.globalpharmacyplus.com and has observed that your website introduces into interstate commerce misbranded and unapproved new drugs in violation of sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a)].\n",
      "There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As discussed below, FDA has observed that www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers drug products for sale in the U.S. that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19.\n",
      "FDA has also observed that www.globalpharmacyplus.com introduces into interstate commerce unapproved and misbranded drugs for which the FDA-approved version is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. A REMS is a drug safety program that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. REMS are designed to reinforce medication use behaviors and actions that support the safe use of that medication.\n",
      "In addition, FDA has observed that www.globalpharmacyplus.com introduces into interstate commerce unapproved and misbranded drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index (NTI). NTI drugs are drugs where small differences in dose or blood concentration may lead to serious therapeutic failures and/or adverse drug reactions that are life-threatening or result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Substituting an NTI drug without the U.S. prescriber’s direction poses significant health risks to patients. Given the serious safety concerns with these products, the easy availability of these products via the Internet poses significant risks to U.S. consumers.\n",
      "There are inherent risks to consumers who purchase unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs. Unapproved new drugs do not carry the same assurances of safety and effectiveness as those drugs subject to FDA oversight. Drugs that have circumvented regulatory safeguards may be contaminated, counterfeit, contain varying amounts of active ingredients, or contain different ingredients altogether. Accordingly, FDA requests that www.globalpharmacyplus.com cease offering any unapproved or misbranded drugs for sale to U.S. consumers. This is critical to shielding the American public from harm.\n",
      "Unapproved New Drugs:\n",
      "Certain products offered for sale by www.globalpharmacyplus.com are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or because they are intended to affect the structure or function of the body. These drugs are also new drugs as defined by section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)], because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their labeled uses. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(a)]. No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act are in effect for these products. Accordingly, their introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce violates sections 301(d) [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)] and 505(a) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "For example, www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers molnupiravir marketed as “Molnunat 200.” Your website states, “Molnupiravir is an oral medication, that is authorized by the FDA to treat Covid-19. Molnupiravir is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Early treatment with the drug reduces the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk patients that have or have not been vaccinated.” There are no approved drug applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect for the “Molnunat 200” offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. Moreover, while there is an FDA-authorized version of molnupiravir currently available in the U.S. under an emergency use authorization (EUA) pursuant to section 564 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 21 U.S.C. §360bbb-3), FDA has not authorized for emergency use the “Molnunat 200” offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com.3 FDA-authorized molnupiravir is an unapproved drug for which FDA has issued an EUA for emergency use for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.\n",
      "Your website also offers mycophenolate mofetil marketed as “CellCept 500mg” tablets. Your website states, “CellCept, brand name product by Roche is used to prevent your body from rejecting a kidney, liver, or heart transplant. CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) lowers your body’s immune system.” While there are FDA-approved versions of mycophenolate mofetil tablets, including CellCept, on the market in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect for the “CellCept 500mg” tablets offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in recipients of allogeneic kidney, heart or liver transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants. FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil products, including mycophenolate mofetil tablets, are subject to a REMS program that requires healthcare providers to report pregnancies to a registry and includes an educational component regarding fetal toxicity. FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil also bears a boxed warning, commonly referred to as a “black box warning,” which is the strongest warning FDA requires, indicating that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or even life-threatening adverse effects. The boxed warning addresses the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations, increased risk of developing lymphoma and other malignancies, and the increased susceptibility to infection.\n",
      "Additionally, www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers tacrolimus pictured as “Tacrolimus Capsules Tacrograf – 0.5”. Your website states, “Prograf (Tacrolimus) is used to lower the body’s immune system to help fight infections. Tacrolimus is most widely used on organ transplant recipients to have a better chance of the organ to be accepted in their body.” Your website also states, “Generic Prograf is used together with other medications to prevent your body from rejecting organs such as heart, liver, or kidney transplant.” While there are FDA-approved versions of tacrolimus on the market in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect for the “Tacrolimus Capsules Tacrograf – 0.5” offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. Capsules of tacrolimus administered orally are NTI drugs. FDA-approved tacrolimus capsules are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult and pediatric patients receiving certain transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants. FDA-approved tacrolimus bears a boxed warning addressing an increased risk for developing serious infections and malignancies with tacrolimus or other immunosuppressants that may lead to hospitalization or death.\n",
      "Misbranded Drugs:\n",
      "A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)] include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n",
      "Because the aforementioned drugs are prescription drugs intended for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by a layperson, adequate directions cannot be written such that a layperson can use the products safely for the intended uses. Consequently, the labeling for these drugs fails to bear adequate directions for use, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. In addition, because the drugs are not approved in the U.S., they are also not exempt under 21 CFR 201.115(a) from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. By offering these drugs for sale to U.S. consumers, www.globalpharmacyplus.com is causing the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n",
      "These drugs are also misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)] because they fail to bear “adequate warnings against use…where [their] use may be dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application....” This is particularly concerning because, as noted above, FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil products, including CellCept, are subject to a REMS program to mitigate the risk of embryofetal toxicity associated with use of mycophenolate during pregnancy. Your website www.globalpharmacyplus.com is causing important safety measures that are put in place for the FDA-approved versions of this drug to be bypassed.\n",
      "FDA is sending this Warning Letter to www.globalpharmacyplus.com because of the inherent risks to consumers who purchase misbranded and unapproved new drugs. This letter is not intended to identify all the ways in which your products or operations might be in violation of the law. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products you offer for sale are in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to address any violations of the FD&C Act (which may include the offer for sale of similarly misbranded and/or unapproved new drugs other than the drugs noted above). We advise you to review your website, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you are not distributing misbranded products in violation of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Please notify this office in writing within 15 working days describing the specific steps you have taken to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. Include an explanation of each step being taken to remedy and prevent the recurrence of any violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction, without further notice. If you cannot complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within 15 working days.\n",
      "If you are not located in the U.S., please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs may be detained or refused admission. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that your products referenced above appear to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the U.S.\n",
      "Please direct your response and any inquiries to FDA at FDAInternetPharmacyTaskForce-CDER@fda.hhs.gov and COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.Sincerely,\n",

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "RE: 615777\n",
      "Dear Mrs. Young:\n",
      "This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website and social media accounts (e.g., Instagram and Facebook) for several Young Living Consultants in May 2022 and has determined that your Young Living Consultants market many of your products, including, but not limited to, Frankincense Essential Oil, Lemon Essential Oil, Lavender Essential Oil, DiGize Essential Oil Blend, Thieves Essential Oil Blend (hereinafter \"Essential Oil\" products), Lemongrass Vitality, Peppermint Vitality (hereinafter \"Vitality\" products), Ningxia (hereinafter “Ningxia” product), Nature’s Ultra CBD Beauty Boost, Nature’s Ultra CBD Muscle Rub, Nature’s Ultra CBD Pep Bundle, Nature’s Ultra Calm CBD Roll-On, Nature’s Ultra Cinnamon CBD Oil, Nature’s Ultra Citrus CBD Oil, and Nature’s Ultra Cool Mint CBD Oil (hereinafter \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products) and that you take orders for these products from your websites at the internet addresses www.youngliving.com and https://naturesultra.com.\n",
      "Additionally, we have also reviewed social media accounts of your Young Living Consultants at www.stillbeingmolly.com, www.instagram.com/awelllivedlife, www.instagram.com/peace.love.essentials, www.instagram.com/thehollanderhome, www.instagram.com/tiffaney_ann, and www.facebook.com/essentialoilsaddict. You market your Young Living “Essential Oil”, “Vitality”, “Ningxia”, and “Nature’s Ultra CBD” products through these paid consultants. Your compensation plan for your consultants is explained on your website at https://www.youngliving.com/us/en/company/compensation-plan. Consumers interested in your products are then redirected by your consultants to your websites www.youngliving.com and www.naturesultra.com to purchase your products and/or register as “members” (i.e., consultants).\n",
      "Your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. The intended use of a product may be determined by, among other things, its labeling, advertising, and the circumstances surrounding its distribution [21 C.F.R. § 201.128]. As explained further below, these products are also unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs. Introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.External Link Disclaimer\n",
      "Examples of claims found on your websites, as well as your Young Living Consultants’ social media account postings, that provide evidence of the intended uses of your products (as defined by 21 CFR § 201.128) as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n",

      "Unapproved New Drugs\n",
      "Based on the above claims, your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are drugs. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Accordingly, your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here1, new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No FDA-approved application is in effect for any of these \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, or \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a), 331(d).\n",
      "Misbranded Drugs\n",
      "Your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “ Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) if the drug’s labeling fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended [21 CFR § 201.5]. Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Based on the above-referenced claims, your \"Essential Oil”, \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are intended to prevent, treat, or cure conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners, such as urinary tract infection, yeast infection, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney stones, addiction, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, diabetes, drug withdrawal, epilepsy, glaucoma, and Parkinson’s disease. Accordingly, your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are considered prescription drugs under section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)] and adequate directions for their use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes.\n",
      "Under 21 CFR §§ 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved application is in effect for your products.\n",
      "Consequently, your \"Essential Oil\", \"Vitality\", “Ningxia”, and \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1).\n",
      "The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n",
      "CBD-containing Drugs\n",
      "Even if your \"Nature's Ultra CBD\" products were considered nonprescription drugs, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. CBD is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the Act. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR § 330.1(e).2,3\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n",
      "In addition, we offer the following comment:\n",
      "• On the website www.stillbeingmolly.com (Molly Buckley Stillman, Consultant #1852080), under the Essential Oil category, in the “20 Uses for Frankincense Essential Oil” post: Number 15 states, “For new moms, apply one drop daily [of Frankincense Essential Oil] to the umbilical cord stump on your newborn until it falls off.” Please be aware that applying non-sterile, non-antimicrobial products topically to an umbilical cord may cause infection.\n",
      "Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps that you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n",

      "1 For example, under section 505G of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met, including conformity with an applicable OTC monograph. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on the above-referenced claims, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications. Further, even if certain of your products, such as your Nature's Ultra CBD Muscle Rub, were marketed only for nonprescription indications, it would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application. For example, CBD—considered an active ingredient under 21 C.F.R. § 201.66(b)(2) due to its prominent featuring on the product labeling—is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the Act. Additionally, this product would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(ee)] because it would be a nonprescription drug subject to section 505G of the Act that does not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section and is not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355].\n",
      "2 21 CFR § 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that \"the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered\". A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.\n",
      "3 Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. See https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.\n"

      "WARNING LETTER\n",
      "Re: CMS # 619398\n",
      "Dear Mr. Carranza:\n",
      "From June 28 to August 25, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) inspection of SERGIO CARRANZA DBA MR CHESCOS, located at 11718 McGallion Rd, Houston, Texas. We also conducted an inspection on August 8, 2018. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n",
      "During the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the inspection on August 25, 2021, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your response dated September 9, 2021, in which you state that you “…will try to look for someone who knows about this system since this is brand new to me as soon as possible.” Your response does not provide any documentation demonstrating you have taken appropriate corrective action.\n",
      "Your significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n",
      "You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods you import, including the following:\n",
      "• Cola flavored carbonated soft drinks imported from foreign supplier (b)(4)\n",
      "• Grape flavored carbonated soft drinks imported from foreign supplier (b)(4)\n",
      "• Banana flavored carbonated soft drinks imported from foreign supplier (b)(4)\n",
      "The above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n",
      "This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods you import into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the products. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41, at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act.\n",
      "Additionally, we note that you may meet the definition of a “very small importer” under 21 CFR 1.500. If you meet the definition, you are still required to follow FSVP requirements. If you are a very small importer and you choose to comply with the modified requirements in 21 CFR 1.512, you must document that you meet the definition of very small importer as required per 21 CFR 1.512(b)(1)(i). If this section applies and you choose to comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, you are required to comply with the requirements in sections 1.502, 1.503, and 1.509. However, you are not required to comply with the requirements in sections 1.504 through 1.508 or 1.510. In addition, for each food you import, you must obtain written assurance, before importing the food and at least every 2 years thereafter, that your foreign supplier is producing the food in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least the same level of public health protection as those required under section 418 or 419 of the FD&C Act, if either is applicable, and the implementing regulations, and is producing the food in compliance with sections 402 and 403(w) of the FD&C Act (21 CFR 1.512(b)(3)(i)).\n",
      "You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n",
      "Please send your reply to Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Virginia Ramos, Compliance Officer, the Division of Southwest Imports, 216 W. Village Blvd., Suite 107, Laredo, Texas 78041. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Virginia Ramos via email at Virginia.Ramos@fda.hhs.gov.

      "June 17, 2020\n",
      "Dear Mr. Kurre:\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Vega Life Sciences Private Limited, FEI 3015658387, at Plot No. D-15, 16, 21 & 22, Phase-I, I.D.A. Pashamylaram, Patencheru (M), Sangareddy District, Telangana, from November 25 to 28, 2019.\n",
      "This warning letter summarizes significant deviations from current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API).\n",
      "Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "We reviewed your December 19, 2019, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.\n",
      "During our inspection, our investigators observed specific deviations including, but not limited to, the following.\n",
      "1. Failure to control and monitor solvent recovery procedures to ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse in API manufacturing.\n",
      "Our inspection found that your firm acts as a contract solvent recovery facility for your customer’s (b)(4) API manufacturing operations. Solvents recovered at your facility include (b)(4).\n",
      "Your firm failed to establish and follow procedures to evaluate and control impurity risks associated with your solvent recovery operations. For example:Inadequate Testing of Recovered Solvents\n",
      "Your firm failed to follow your gas chromatography (GC) test method procedure for recovered (b)(4). The procedure requires use of a standard for ensuring the batch meets the Identification by GC recovered solvent specification. We reviewed analytical data packages for approximately (b)(4) batches of recovered (b)(4) processed by your firm in 2019 and found they lacked chromatograms representing the use of a standard. Furthermore, your firm stated to the investigators that standards were never run during GC analysis of recovered (b)(4) in 2018 and 2019.\n",
      "In your response, you provided no explanation for this deviation and made no commitment to investigate the scope of this deficiency to determine if other test methods or procedures were not followed. Your response also lacked a risk assessment to determine potential product impact.\n",
      "Failure to Establish an Impurity Profile for Recovered Solvents or Investigate Extraneous Peaks in Chromatograms\n",
      "Your firm failed to establish an impurity profile for recovered solvents and maintain appropriate oversight of your operations for the control of unknown impurities. Extraneous peaks were observed in more than (b)(4) batches of recovered (b)(4) processed at your facility between 2018 and 2019. The batches were released by your firm without investigation and you failed to inform your customer of any potential impurities. You stated that your customer instructed you to focus only on the peak representing the recovered solvent, however this is not adequate. Unknown peaks observed in chromatograms of recovered solvents may represent unanticipated impurities that can impact the quality of your customer’s API and should be thoroughly investigated.\n",
      "Your response is inadequate. Your evaluation of the extraneous peaks observed in recovered solvent chromatograms was not comprehensive and did not include a thorough manufacturing evaluation to determine if your solvent recovery operations contributed impurities to the recovered solvent.\n",
      "During the inspection, your firm provided a written statement indicating that you had terminated processing recovered solvents for customers. However in your response you indicated that all future customer products would include quality agreements, which suggests that you may resume such operations in the future. Your firm has not provided sufficient details or procedures to demonstrate the capability of predicting, controlling, testing, and preventing impurities or cross contamination associated with your solvent recovery processes.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "• A comprehensive investigation into your firm’s failure to follow internal procedures including test methods. Include a detailed description of the scope and root causes of your lapses and list all associated corrective actions with timeframes for completion.\n",
      "• A detailed plan describing how you will implement an ongoing program for evaluating the effectiveness of your solvent recovery operations monitoring process control to ensure stable manufacturing and prevention of unanticipated impurities during solvent recovery operations.\n",
      "Vega Life Sciences Private Limited, Telangana FEI 3015658387 page 3\n",
      "• A procedure requiring an impurity profile analysis and risk assessment for all solvent recovery operations. The scope of the procedure should include recovered solvents for internal and external use.\n",
      "• An updated procedure for handling unknown peaks in chromatograms.\n",
      "2. Failure to have adequate cleaning procedures to prevent contamination or carry-over of a material that would alter the quality of the API.\n",
      "The cleaning of your nondedicated manufacturing equipment used to recover customer solvents including (b)(4) is inadequate. Your firm failed to ensure that your cleaning procedure was sufficient to prevent carryover or contamination for nondedicated equipment used to recover spent solvents. Your firm stated during the inspection that these requirements were not met. Additionally, your firm stated that there were no records to document cleaning of nondedicated equipment used to process recovered solvents including product changeover cleaning.\n",
      "In your response, you provided examples of equipment cleaning records but did not include an explanation or justification regarding why you told our investigators during the inspection that these documents did not exist.\n",
      "Your response also failed to include a thorough evaluation designed to ensure that all equipment including nondedicated storage, receiving, and charging tanks were properly cleaned according to approved procedures.\n",
      "In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "• A corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan, based on the retrospective assessment, that includes appropriate remediations to your cleaning processes and practices, and timelines for completion. Provide a detailed summary of vulnerabilities in your process for lifecycle management of equipment cleaning. Describe improvements to your cleaning program including enhancements to cleaning effectiveness, improved ongoing verification of proper cleaning execution for all products and equipment, and all other needed remediations.\n",
      "• Appropriate improvements to your cleaning program, with special emphasis on incorporating conditions identified as worst case in your drug manufacturing operation. In addition, describe the steps that must be taken in your change management system before introduction of new manufacturing equipment or new manufacturing operations.\n",
      "• A summary of updated SOPs that ensure an appropriate program is in place for cleaning procedures for products, processes, and equipment.\n",
      "• A comprehensive investigation into your firm’s CGMP documentation practices. Include a detailed description of the scope and root causes of your documentation lapses and list all associated corrective actions with timeframes for completion.\n",
      "3. Failure to exercise sufficient controls over computerized systems to prevent unauthorized access or changes to data and failure to have adequate controls to prevent omission of data.\n",
      "Your firm failed to implement adequate controls to ensure the integrity of data generated at your facility including:\n",
      "• Missing raw data files associated with recovered solvent testing were observed in folders on the local hard drive of the operating system connected to the GC instrument. Your firm indicated that the files appear to have been deleted.\n",
      "• Quality Control analysts shared the same username and password for the operating system on each workstation and the analytical software for the GC.\n",
      "• Recovered solvent data on the stand-alone computerized system for the GC were not backed up as required per your approved procedure.\n",
      "• Your firm did not have a procedure governing the audit trail or its retention. During the inspection, the GC analytical software was configured to retain the audit trail for only (b)(4).\n",
      "Your firm failed to include a comprehensive, systematic plan for evaluating your practices and procedures to ensure data integrity controls are applied throughout your firm. Additionally, you failed to conduct a risk assessment addressing potential impacts to product as a result of the inadequate data integrity controls.\n",
      "Data Integrity Remediation\n",
      "Your quality system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. See FDA’s guidance document Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP for guidance on establishing and following CGMP compliant data integrity practices at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/data-integrity-and-compliance-drug-cgmp-questions-and-answers-guidance-industry.\n",
      "We strongly recommend that you retain a qualified consultant to assist in your data integrity remediation. In response to this letter, provide the following:\n",
      "• A comprehensive investigation into the extent of the inaccuracies in data records and reporting including results of the data review for drugs distributed to the United States. Include a detailed description of the scope and root causes of your data integrity lapses.\n",
      "• A current risk assessment of the potential effects of the observed failures on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment should include analyses of the risks to patients caused by the release of drugs affected by a lapse of data integrity and analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations.\n",
      "• A management strategy for your firm that includes the details of your global CAPA plan. The detailed corrective action plan should describe how you intend to ensure the reliability and completeness of all data generated by your firm including microbiological and analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted to FDA.\n",
      "CGMP Consultant Recommended\n",
      "Based upon the nature of the deviations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements if your firm intends to resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. We also recommend that the qualified consultant perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and that the consultant evaluates the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA.\n",
      "Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.\n",
      "Solvent Recovery Operations Terminated\n",
      "We acknowledge your commitment to terminate processing recovered solvents for customers at this facility for the U.S. market. If you plan to resume producing recovered solvents for the U.S. supply chain, notify this office in writing.\n",

      "The deviations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deviations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of these deviations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other deviations.\n",
      "FDA placed your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on April 14, 2020.\n",
      "Until you correct all deviations completely and we confirm your compliance with CGMP, FDA may withhold approval of any new drug applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer.\n",
      "Failure to correct these deviations may also result in the FDA continuing to refuse admission of articles manufactured at Vega Life Sciences Private Limited at Plot No. D-15, 16, 21 & 22, Phase-I, I.D.A. Pashamylaram, Patencheru (M), Sangareddy District, Telangana into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles under this authority may be subject to refusal of admission, in that the methods and controls used in their manufacture do not appear to conform to CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n",
      "After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done since our inspection to correct your deviations and to prevent their recurrence. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.\n",
